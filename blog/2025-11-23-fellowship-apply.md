We're proud to launch the LMSYS Fellowship Program!

This year, the program will provide funding to full-time PhD students in the United States who have made significant contributions to the open-source AI infrastructure community, especially to our flagship projects.

Fellowship recipients will receive partial tuition and fee support for the next two years.

The application window is November 23 – December 7, 2025.
Applications are evaluated based on the impact of the applicants’ open-source contributions and the alignment with our areas of interest.
Recipients will be announced within a few weeks after the application deadline.

PhD students interested in applying can email fellowship@lmsys.org with an application statement and their resume.

This fellowship is made possible by donations from the Ying and Lianmin Giving Fund.
