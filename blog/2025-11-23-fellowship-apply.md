We are thrilled to announce the launch of the LMSYS Fellowship Program!

This year, the program is dedicated to supporting full-time PhD students in the United States who have made significant contributions to the open-source AI infrastructure community.

Fellowship recipients will be awarded up to $50,000 to assist with tuition and fees over the next two years.

The application window is open from November 23 through December 7, 2025. We will evaluate candidates based on the impact of their research and open-source contributions, as well as their alignment with our areas of interest. Recipients will be announced a few weeks following the deadline.

PhD students interested in applying are invited to email their application statement and resume to fellowship@lmsys.org.

This fellowship is made possible by donations from the Ying and Lianmin Giving Fund.
