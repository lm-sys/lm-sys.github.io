## TL;DR

CUDA Graphs promise to remove kernel-launch overhead, but getting close to that benefit in a real inference engine requires graphing as much of the workload as possible without sacrificing compatibility, startup time, or memory.

In SGLang, we refactored CUDA Graph support around a common runner/backend interface, making different capture strategies reusable across execution paths. For the more complex prefill path, the SGLang community introduced Breakable CUDA Graph and pioneered full CUDA Graph support with the FA4 and FlashInfer attention backends. Both techniques were first developed in SGLang as open-source serving techniques. We also dive deeper into CUDA Graph memory management, including memory reuse across shapes and graph segments, which is becoming an increasingly important part of SGLang’s overall memory management.

For prefill, Breakable CUDA Graph is now SGLang's default. It reaches the same segmented execution as the `torch.compile`-based piecewise backend in roughly a quarter of the code (521 versus 1,771 lines), builds prefill graphs 3.8–5.2× faster because no compilation is involved, and has broader coverage for complex functionality naturally. Full CUDA Graph for prefill goes further, using request padding to capture the whole forward even for dynamic prefill workloads. Measured on prefill alone, BCG is 1.70× faster than eager execution and full capture reaches 1.93×.

## Background

An inference step is not a single kernel but a sequence of many GPU operations. In modern LLM serving engines, repeatedly launching these operations from the CPU can introduce noticeable overhead, especially for latency-sensitive workloads. CUDA Graph reduces this overhead by recording the GPU work once and replaying it with much lower launch overhead.

But applying CUDA Graphs effectively in a modern inference engine is not straightforward. The graph design must fit different execution phases, remain compatible with complex kernels and runtime-dependent behavior, and control the capture-time and memory overhead introduced by the graphs themselves. As inference stacks become more complex, proper CUDA Graph integration becomes increasingly important.

This post walks through how CUDA Graph support is built in SGLang and what we changed:

## CUDA Graph in SGLang: the Runner/Backend Split and Flexible Combinations

Before this refactor, CUDA Graph support had grown around individual execution paths. Decode, prefill, and speculative decoding each had their own CUDA Graph runners, with overlapping logic for capture shapes, static buffers, replay, and graph configuration. As more execution modes and capture strategies were added, this duplication made it harder to reuse infrastructure and made CUDA Graph-related server arguments increasingly ambiguous.

The refactor [[#23906](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/23906)] separates these responsibilities into two layers. A **runner** manages the execution-specific state needed for capture and replay: captured shapes, static input buffers, attention metadata, and the padding of live batches into captured shapes. A **backend** determines how that execution is captured, whether as one full graph, a sequence of breakable segments, or compiler-generated pieces.

Because runners depend only on a common backend interface, each execution path can choose its capture strategy independently. Prefill and decode have separate runners, and speculative decoding adds more: the EAGLE draft, draft-extend and frozen-KV MTP draft steps each get their own runner built on the decode runner, while target verify is the decode runner itself, capturing more than one token per request.

<p style="text-align: center; color: #666; font-style: italic;">The runner prepares each execution path for capture and replay, while the backend determines how the forward is turned into replayable graphs: as one full graph, segmented during capture, or traced and split before capture.</p>

### Full CUDA Graph

The full backend captures one `torch.cuda.CUDAGraph` for each selected shape, with no eager regions and the fewest replay-time launches of the three backends. This works naturally for decode: each request contributes one token, so the primary shape variable is batch size, which can be covered by a set of captured batch-size buckets. Prefill varies along more dimensions and is therefore harder; we discuss it in [its own section](#full-cuda-graph-for-prefill).

### Breakable CUDA Graph

Breakable CUDA Graph (BCG) captures graph-safe regions while allowing selected operations to run eagerly between graph segments. An incompatible operation can be marked with `@eager_on_graph`; capture stops before the marked function and resumes afterward, producing a sequence of CUDA Graph segments separated by eager regions.

Unlike compiler-based piecewise capture, these breaks are inserted directly during capture rather than discovered by tracing the full model first. We discuss the mechanism and why SGLang moved to this design in the next section.

### TC piecewise CUDA Graph

The third backend reaches similar segmentation through a compiler. `torch.compile` traces the forward with `fullgraph=True`, the resulting FX graph is split at registered split points, and each piece is compiled and captured on its own. It was SGLang's first answer to partial CUDA Graph capture and still ships for platforms where breakable capture has not been validated.

## Breakable CUDA Graph: Eager Breaks without a Compiler

CUDA Graph traditionally requires the captured region to be fully graph-compatible. In practice, modern inference workloads contain operations that cannot be captured directly. Prefill attention is a common example: some attention backends depend on runtime metadata and host-side preparation. A single incompatible operation can therefore prevent CUDA Graph from covering a much larger part of the forward.

We introduced **Breakable CUDA Graph (BCG)** to make capture more flexible. The mechanism and the `@eager_on_graph` decorator landed first as part of CUDA Graph debug mode in [[#19102](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/19102)], and were then built into a breakable piecewise backend for prefill in [[#22218](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/22218)]. Instead of requiring the entire forward to be graph-compatible, BCG allows selected operations to run eagerly while capturing the graph-compatible regions around them. At a high level, the forward becomes a sequence of CUDA Graph segments connected by explicit eager breaks.

### Design and Mechanism

CUDA Graph works best when replay follows a fixed sequence of GPU operations without host participation. Real inference forwards, however, contain operations that do not fit naturally inside that model: attention backends may plan from live sequence lengths, collectives may involve runtime coordination, and serving features may update state dynamically.

Giving up on CUDA Graph whenever one such operation appears would leave much of the forward uncaptured. BCG instead lets developers mark the incompatible region directly with `@eager_on_graph`. During capture, the current graph segment is closed when execution reaches the marked function, the function runs eagerly, and capture resumes afterward in a new segment.

At replay time, the recorded graph segments and eager functions run in the same order. The tensor crossing an eager break is created by the preceding captured segment and registered as a persistent boundary buffer, so its device address remains fixed. The following captured segment is captured against that same address. During replay, the eager function therefore writes its newly computed result back into this boundary buffer rather than returning a newly allocated tensor, allowing the next segment to read the updated value from the address it was originally captured with. BCG never inspects or traces the operations inside the eager region: they only need to execute correctly.

From a functionality perspective, BCG and the earlier torch-compile-based piecewise backend produce the same kind of replayable structure: CUDA Graph segments separated by eager regions. The key difference is how that structure is constructed. TC piecewise first asks the compiler to understand the full forward and then splits the resulting graph. BCG places the splits directly while capture is happening.

### Benefits

**Faster startup.** For compiler-based piecewise graphs, compilation — not capture — dominates setup: `torch.compile` accounts for 78–86% of the time spent preparing prefill graphs, and it grows with model complexity, reaching 90 seconds on a 235B MoE and 158 seconds on GLM-5.2. BCG removes that phase entirely, reaching segmented execution in a single capture pass.

The compilation overhead was also visible in day-to-day development. In our CI setup at the time, compilation was often repeated across test runs, making CUDA Graph tests noticeably slower. Better caching could mitigate this, but removing the compiler from the capture path also removed this extra source of complexity from the development loop.

**Broader compatibility.** SGLang relies heavily on custom CUDA, Triton, and JIT-compiled kernels that are not native PyTorch operators. To make these kernels visible to `torch.compile`, we often had to wrap them through `torch.library` and provide fake implementations for tracing. This introduced compiler-specific scaffolding throughout the kernel stack.

More importantly, the compiler also constrained **where graph boundaries could be placed**. Inputs and outputs crossing a registered operator boundary had to be representable by the compiler. When the natural boundary involved more specialized runtime state or return types, we sometimes had to search for a different cutting point or enlarge the eager region simply to expose an interface the compiler could handle. As the serving stack grew, the compiler boundary increasingly influenced the structure of code that was otherwise unrelated to compilation.

BCG removes this constraint at eager breaks: the graph system does not need to understand how the marked function is implemented or trace through its internals, allowing graph boundaries to follow serving logic rather than compiler tracing and type requirements. As CUDA Graph had to coexist with DP attention, MoE all-to-all backends, LoRA, PD disaggregation, hierarchical cache, deterministic inference, and other rapidly evolving features, making CUDA Graph work increasingly started to feel like a torch.compile integration project. New kernels often meant custom-op registrations and fake implementations, while new features could force us to move graph boundaries simply to satisfy the compiler. With BCG, incompatible regions can remain ordinary eager execution, substantially reducing this compiler-specific engineering overhead.

**Debuggable by construction.** A captured CUDA Graph replays as an opaque unit: ordinary Python does not execute inside it, which makes prints, assertions, and step-by-step inspection difficult. BCG naturally leaves eager regions where normal Python still runs on every replay.

SGLang extends this idea with `--debug-cuda-graph` [[#19102](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/19102)], which effectively wraps the whole forward in an eager break. The model then executes eagerly while still going through the CUDA Graph runner, static buffers, replay path, and metadata preparation. This provides a useful debugging boundary: if the problem remains, it is likely in the model or runner path; if it disappears, capture itself becomes the primary suspect.

### BCG in Diffusion

BCG has also been adopted by SGLang’s diffusion stack [[#27436](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/27436)]. Diffusion repeatedly executes the same DiT forward during denoising, making CUDA Graph especially useful when those forwards contain many small, launch-bound kernels.

<ul style="line-height: 1.75;">
  <li style="padding-top: 0.55em;"><strong>Capture the real serving shapes.</strong> Resolution, video frame count, prompt-conditioning length, CFG mode, and the selected transformer can all affect the capture signature. We warm up the shapes that are actually served and fall back to eager execution for unseen signatures.</li>
  <li style="padding-top: 0.55em;"><strong>Break around dynamic operations.</strong> Operations such as dynamic attention and runtime-dependent metadata preparation remain eager, while BCG captures the stable computation around them without requiring <code>torch.compile</code> to understand the full DiT forward.</li>
  <li style="padding-top: 0.55em;"><strong>Exploit repeated denoising structure.</strong> Diffusion repeatedly executes the same DiT structure across denoising steps. BCG captures the stable regions once and replays them throughout the denoising loop, while dynamic regions remain eager.</li>
</ul>

This is particularly effective when execution is launch-bound. For example, after warmup, Qwen-Image at 512×512 on a single B200 improves from 6.48 s to 2.45 s end-to-end latency, and Z-Image improves from 1.231 s to 0.662 s.

<p style="text-align: center; color: #666; font-style: italic;">End-to-end latency after warmup. Each bar pair uses the same model workload and seed.</p>

The broader lesson is that BCG removes launch overhead; it does not reduce model FLOPs or make compute-bound kernels cheaper. Its advantage is largest when exposed launch gaps are a meaningful fraction of execution time.

## Full CUDA Graph for Prefill

Full CUDA Graph is straightforward for decode because each request contributes one token: the main varying dimension is batch size. Prefill is harder because a batch varies in two dimensions at once — the total number of tokens and the number of requests those tokens belong to — while a captured graph requires both to remain fixed. Together with attention backends that depend on runtime metadata, this made full CUDA Graph difficult to apply to prefill and was one of the main reasons we adopted Breakable CUDA Graph there.

More recently, we found ways to make prefill execution sufficiently static for full CUDA Graph [[#27988](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/27988)], including restructuring how request slots and attention metadata are represented so that supported attention backends no longer have to remain outside the graph.

### Making prefill static

SGLang fixes the token dimension with token buckets. A live batch is padded to the nearest captured token count, much like decode pads batch size to a captured bucket.

The request dimension is handled separately. Each captured graph reserves a fixed number of request slots. Live requests occupy the first slots; unused ones are rewritten as zero-length sentinels, with zero sequence and extend lengths and offsets parked after the real tokens. If a batch contains more requests than the graph has slots, it falls back to eager execution.

<img src="/images/blog/breakable_cuda_graph/full-prefill.svg" style="width: 76vw; max-width: 860px; min-width: 300px;" />

<p style="text-align: center; color: #666; font-style: italic;">At replay, tokens are padded to the captured bucket while unused request slots are filled with zero-length sentinels.</p>

The sentinel metadata must be rewritten on every replay because the captured graph still reads the entire request table. Attention metadata is likewise rebuilt outside the graph for the padded batch before replay. Today, full prefill capture therefore requires attention backends that support this style of metadata preparation, including FlashAttention and FlashInfer.

### What does the padding cost?

The two forms of padding have very different costs.

Padded tokens are real work. They become actual rows in the captured batch and therefore pass through dense projections as part of the same GEMMs. SGLang carries the true token count separately, allowing MoE routing, attention, and linear-attention kernels to skip much of the padded region, but dense computation still pays for those extra rows.

Empty request slots are much cheaper. In FlashAttention's variable-length scheduler, work is derived from each sequence's actual length rather than assigning a fixed amount of computation to every request slot. A zero-length request therefore contributes essentially no attention work; it mainly adds metadata and a small amount of scheduling overhead.

This asymmetry is important: token padding is the expensive dimension, while request-slot padding is comparatively cheap.

Full prefill capture is still an experimental feature. It has to be enabled explicitly — the engine warns that `full` is experimental and points to breakable or tc_piecewise for production workloads — and it currently works mainly on the FlashAttention (fa4) and FlashInfer backends, which are the ones that build extend-mode metadata the way the captured path needs. Broadening backend support and tuning the bucket and slot choices is still ahead of us.

### Prefill benchmark

With three ways to capture prefill and an eager baseline, the remaining question is what each one costs at replay. Measuring prefill on its own — a fixed input length with a single output token, one request at a time, decode graphs disabled in every arm — on gpt-oss-120b (TP4, 4×GB300), where all four paths run: full capture is 1.93× faster than eager, BCG 1.70×, and TC piecewise 1.45×, so BCG is also 17% faster than the compiler-based backend at replay, not only at build time. On GLM-5.2 only BCG can capture at all — TC piecewise cannot trace the forward and full capture has no path for its sparse attention — and it is 1.60× over eager there. Every curve is flat across a 32× range in prompt length, which is the signature of launch overhead rather than compute.

## Memory Footprint of CUDA Graphs

Memory poses two separate challenges: keeping a segmented capture from multiplying resident memory, and capturing far enough that resident graph memory actually replaces the worst eager activation peak.

### Reuse inside a segmented capture

A segmented backend could easily multiply graph memory: every captured shape contains multiple graph segments, and each segment has intermediates that must remain valid for replay. BCG avoids that multiplication through three forms of reuse.

<ul style="line-height: 1.75;">
  <li style="padding-top: 0.55em;"><strong>One shared memory pool across segments.</strong> Every segment for a captured shape uses the same CUDA Graph pool, allowing intermediate storage to be reused rather than pinned separately for each segment.</li>
  <li style="padding-top: 0.55em;"><strong>Weak references at eager breaks.</strong> Tensors passed into a break are held weakly when the graph pool already owns their storage, avoiding unnecessary Python references that would extend tensor lifetimes. The tensor weak-reference technique comes from vLLM [<a href="https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/9724">#9724</a>], which introduced it so that captured graphs could share output buffers instead of each pinning its own.</li>
  <li style="padding-top: 0.55em;"><strong>One output buffer across capture sizes.</strong> Capture sizes share a single maximum-sized output buffer, sliced to the rows needed by each shape, instead of allocating one output buffer per shape.</li>
</ul>

One value cannot be treated this way: the tensor that carries data across an eager break. The next graph segment is captured against its address, so that buffer must stay alive and be updated in place on every replay.

With these reuse mechanisms, even a large capture table remains modest: 42 shapes across a 78-layer MoE add 2.4 GB of graph memory on GLM-5.2.

### Capture through the chunked-prefill size

CUDA Graphs change the shape of prefill memory usage. Graph memory is resident: it is allocated during capture and remains for the lifetime of the server. Eager activations are transient: each prefill allocates working memory, and the largest supported prefill determines the peak.

Capturing a prefill shape moves much of that transient working set into the graph's resident memory pool. But this only helps for shapes that actually replay a graph. If the capture ladder stops below the maximum prefill size, the largest prefill still falls back to eager execution and retains the original activation peak — while the server also pays for all of the resident graphs below it.

This makes the capture ceiling more important than the number of captured shapes. Since `chunked_prefill_size` bounds the largest single prefill forward, capturing through that size removes the worst eager activation peak.

<img src="/images/blog/breakable_cuda_graph/cg-memory.svg" style="width: 76vw; max-width: 830px; min-width: 300px;" />

<p style="text-align: center; color: #666; font-style: italic;">Prefill memory above the no-graph resident baseline, measured after one prefill at exactly the chunked-prefill size.</p>

Ceilings below the chunk size sit slightly *above* the no-graph baseline: they add resident graphs while the activation peak stays exactly where it was. Once the ceiling reaches the chunk size, the largest prefill finally replays a graph and that peak collapses — to essentially nothing on gpt-oss-120b (0.56 GB to 0.001 GB), and from 1.55 GB to 0.35 GB on GLM-5.2, whose sparse-attention indexer still runs eagerly at a break.

Capturing through the chunked-prefill size buys two things:

<ul style="line-height: 1.75;">
  <li style="padding-top: 0.55em;"><strong>Lower total memory.</strong> The activation peak stops being paid per request, and the total lands below the no-graph baseline — 0.51 GB lower on gpt-oss-120b, 1.10 GB on GLM-5.2. Modest against a footprint of a few hundred gigabytes, but a saving rather than a cost.</li>
  <li style="padding-top: 0.55em;"><strong>Predictable memory usage.</strong> A workload-dependent activation spike becomes a fixed allocation established at capture time. The engine can account for that memory up front instead of reserving headroom for a transient peak that appears only during large prefills.</li>
</ul>
