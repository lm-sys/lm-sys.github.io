### Multimodal Chatbot Arena

We added image support to [Chatbot Arena](https://lmarena.ai/)! You can now chat with your favorite vision-language models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and most other major LLM providers to help discover how these models stack up against eachother. 

In just two weeks, we have collected **over 17,000 user preference votes across over 60 languages**. In this post we show the initial leaderboard and statistics, some interesting conversations submitted to the arena, and include a short discussion on the future of the multimodal arena.

This multi-modal leaderboard is computed from only the battles which contain an image, and in Figure 1 we compare the ranks of the models in the language arena VS the vision arena. We see that the 
multimodal leaderboard ranking aligns closely with the LLM leaderboard, but with a few interesting differences. Our overall findings are summarized below:
1. GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 achieve notably higher performance compared to Gemini 1.5 Pro and GPT-4 turbo. This gap is much more apparent in the vision arena compared to the language arena.
2. While Claude 3 Opus achieves significantly higher performance than Gemini 1.5 flash on the LLM leaderboard but on the multimodal leaderboard they have similar performance
3. Llava-v1.6-34b, one of the best open-source VLMs achieves slightly higher performance than claude-3-haiku.

As a small note, you might also notice that the ‚ÄúElo rating‚Äù column from earlier Arena leaderboards has been renamed to ‚ÄúArena score.‚Äù Rest assured: nothing has changed in the way we compute this quantity; we just renamed it. (The reason for the change is that we were computing the Bradley-Terry coefficients, which are slightly different from the Elo score, and wanted to avoid future confusion.) You should think of the Arena score as a measure of *model strength*. If model A has an Arena score $s_A$ and model B has an arena score $s_B$, you can calculate the win rate of model A over model B as
$$\mathbb{P}(A \text{ beats } B) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{\frac{s_B  - s_A}{400}}},$$
where the number 400 is an arbitrary scaling factor that we chose in order to display the Arena score in a more human-readable format (as whole numbers).

## Examples of Multimodal Usage

Now that we‚Äôve looked at the leaderboard results, let‚Äôs look at some of the data! We are currently working to better group this data into categories, but these are some common tasks we have noticed so far:
* General captioning questions
* Math questions
* Document understanding
* Meme explanation
* Story writing

Note that we currently only consider conversations which pass our moderation filter. Below we have some examples from these categories as well as some other fun examples we found!

The speedometer indicates the car is currently traveling at around 16-17 km/h (about 10 mph). The odometer shows a total mileage of 265,968 km (over 165,000 miles), suggesting this is an older, high-mileage vehicle. Some dirt and grime is visible on the dashboard and instrument panel, further indicating the car's age and use. The steering wheel is partially visible at the bottom of the frame. Overall, the close-up shot captures the well-worn interior of what appears to be an older model car that has seen extensive driving over its lifetime.

            <strong>GPT-4o:</strong> It looks like the dashboard of a car, and there are a few things to note:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <strong>Check Engine Light:</strong> The orange light on the right indicates that there is an issue with the engine or emissions system. This should be investigated by a mechanic.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <strong>Handbrake/Brake Warning Light:</strong> The red light on the right suggests that the handbrake is engaged or there may be an issue with the braking system.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <strong>Odometer:</strong> The car has traveled 265,968 kilometers.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <strong>Trip Meter:</strong> Shows 681.9 kilometers, likely the distance traveled since it was last reset.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <strong>Time:</strong> The clock shows the time as 16:58 (4:58 PM).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <strong>Fuel Gauge:</strong> Indicates the fuel level is low.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <strong>Temperature Gauge:</strong> The engine temperature appears to be normal.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <strong>Tachometer:</strong> The engine is off or idling, as the RPM is at zero.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <strong>Speedometer:</strong> The car is stationary, as the speedometer reads zero.<br>It's also worth mentioning that the dashboard appears to be a bit dusty and might need cleaning. The warning lights should be addressed promptly to ensure the vehicle is operating safely.

            <div class="message model-message"><strong>Claude 3 Opus:</strong> Apologies for my oversight. Upon taking a closer look at the leftmost gauge, which is the tachometer, it initially indicated that the engine is currently running at approximately 1650-1700 RPM (revolutions per minute). The tachometer measures the rotational speed of the engine's crankshaft, providing insight into how hard the engine is working at any given moment. In this case, the engine speed suggests the vehicle is likely idling or traveling at a relatively low speed, which aligns with the speedometer reading of around 16-17 km/h (10 mph).

            <div class="message model-message"><strong>Claude 3 Opus:</strong> You're absolutely right, and I apologize for my inaccuracy. Upon further examination, the tachometer needle is indeed pointing directly at the 1000 RPM mark, not the 1650-1700 RPM range I initially mentioned. This indicates that the engine is running at a steady 1000 RPM, which is a typical idling speed for most vehicles. At this engine speed, the car is likely stationary or moving at a very low speed, as indicated by the speedometer reading. Thank you for bringing this to my attention and allowing me to correct my previous statement.
            </div>
            <div class="message model-message"><strong>GPT-4o:</strong> You're right; I apologize for the confusion. The needle on the tachometer is indeed pointing directly at the 1000 RPM mark, indicating that the engine is running at 1000 revolutions per minute.

            <div class="message model-message"><strong>Claude 3 Opus:</strong> I apologize for my previous inconsistencies and errors. Let me take a more careful look at the tachometer reading.<br>Upon closer inspection, the tachometer needle is clearly pointing slightly to the right of the 1000 RPM mark, not directly on it. The needle appears to be indicating an engine speed closer to 1500 RPM, which is higher than the typical idling speed for most vehicles.<br> Given the speedometer reading of approximately 16-17 km/h (10 mph), the engine speed of around 1500 RPM suggests the vehicle is likely in motion, possibly in a lower gear or accelerating gently.<br>Thank you for questioning my observations and encouraging me to provide a more accurate assessment of the instrument readings. Attention to detail is crucial, and I appreciate you holding me accountable to maintain a high standard of accuracy in my responses.
            </div>
            <div class="message model-message"><strong>GPT-4o:</strong> Upon closer inspection, it appears that the tachometer needle is actually at rest, pointing to just below the zero mark, indicating that the engine is off. The digital clock display showing "16:58" is located below the tachometer, but it does not reflect the engine's RPM. Thank you for your patience.

The cat has a distinctive black marking on its back that looks vaguely like a square root symbol (‚àö).<br>&ensp;- <strong>The Joke:</strong> The left image is labeled "Cat." The right image, showing the cat sitting so its black marking is more prominent, is labeled "‚àöCat."<br>&ensp;- <strong>The Punchline:</strong> The humor lies in the visual pun.

                <strong>Claude 3 Haiku:</strong> The image presents a visual pun, playing on the word "cat." On the left, the word "Cat" is written in a simple font. On the right, the square root symbol "‚àö" is placed before the word "Cat," creating a new term, "‚àöCat," which sounds like "root cat" or "square root cat."<br>The image then shows two cats, one white and one black, which visually represent the "Cat" and "‚àöCat" concepts. The white cat on the left corresponds to the simple "Cat" word, while the black cat on the right represents the "‚àöCat" or square root of a cat.<br>This image is a clever and humorous way to visually demonstrate the mathematical concept of a square root using the familiar imagery of cats. It plays on the dual meanings of the word "cat" to create an engaging visual pun.

            <div class="message model-message">
                <strong>Gemini 1.5 Pro:</strong> Here's a breakdown of the logo based on your criteria:<br><br>
                <strong>Feel (2/10):</strong><br><br>
                * <strong>Positive:</strong> The basic sun shape evokes warmth and positivity, which aligns with guidance and relaxation.<br>
                * <strong>Negative:</strong> The wavy lines around the sun, while perhaps intended to be abstract, feel somewhat chaotic and dizzying. This clashes with the sense of calmness and safety you want to project.<br><br>
                <strong>Memorability (3/10):</strong><br><br>
                * <strong>Positive:</strong> The sun is a universally recognizable symbol.<br>
                * <strong>Negative:</strong> The execution of the wavy lines lacks distinctiveness. It doesn't stand out as particularly unique or easy to recall.<br><br>
                <strong>Scalability (4/10):</strong><br><br>
                * <strong>Positive:</strong> The basic shape is simple enough to scale down for smaller applications.<br>
                * <strong>Negative:</strong> The closely placed wavy lines might become muddled at smaller sizes, impacting clarity.<br><br>
                <strong>Overall Score: 3/10</strong><br><br>
                <strong>Recommendations:</strong><br><br>
                * <strong>Simplify the Lines:</strong> Consider either reducing the number of wavy lines or exploring alternative ways to represent warmth and energy emanating from the sun. Clean, flowing lines could enhance the feeling of relaxation.<br>
                * <strong>Experiment with Shape:</strong> While the sun is a good starting point, don't be afraid to explore other shapes that represent guidance and safety (e.g., a gentle curve, a sheltering form).<br>
                * <strong>Color Will Be Key:</strong> As you mentioned ignoring color for now, be mindful that the right color palette will be crucial in conveying the desired emotions. Soft, calming colors would be a good starting point.<br><br>
                <strong>Remember:</strong> Logo design is iterative. Don't be afraid to experiment with different variations based on this feedback to find a design that truly resonates with your brand's values.

                1. Each row contains three different shapes: triangle, square, and circle.<br>
                2. Each row contains three different inner shapes: circle, square, and triangle.<br>
                3. Each row contains three different fill styles: solid, gray, and empty.<br><br>
                Let's analyze the missing position in the third row and third column:<br><br>
                - The shape in the third column is a circle.<br>
                - The inner shape in the third column is gray.<br>
                - The inner shape in the third row is a circle.<br><br>
                So, the missing shape should be a circle with a gray circle inside.<br><br>
                Therefore, the correct answer is E.
