> *A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.*

We're excited to introduce Miles, an enterprise-facing reinforcement learning framework designed for large-scale MoE training and production workloads. This introductory chapter will be the beginning of a series of tech blogs.

Miles is forked from slime, the lightweight RL framework that has quietly powered many of today’s post-training pipelines and large MoE training runs. Building on slime’s foundation, Miles aims to deliver a smooth and controllable RL experience for teams that need reliability and scale in real-world deployments.

The GitHub link for Miles can be found [here](https://github.com/radixark/miles).

## 🧠 Starting Point: slime - A Lightweight and Customizable RL Framework

Every mile of progress begins with one well-placed step - slime it is. As a very lightweight and customizable RL framework, slime has been growing popular across the community. It has also been battle-tested in large MoE training, where it is used to train GLM-4.6. slime comes with a few elegant design principles:

### Native to be performant

Native, structured support of SGLang and Megatron's full optimization stack. Keeping pace with the fast evolution of inference and training frameworks.

### Clear, clean modularity

Its key components—Algorithm / Data / Rollout / Eval—are fully decoupled, letting users plug in new agent types, reward functions, or sampling strategies with minimal change of lines.

### Model scientist-friendly

Every abstraction is readable and designed to be hackable. Algorithm researchers can modify importance sampling, rollout logic, or loss dynamics without touching low-level code. Inference-only and training-only debugging are provided for fast diagnosis of failing runs.

### Community-first

slime evolved through real-world feedback from the LMSYS and SGLang communities. It embodies what open collaboration across research and engineering can achieve.

## ⚙️ Momentum On the Way: What is Recently Implemented

Miles builds on slime but focuses on new hardware (e.g. GB300), large-scale MoE RL, and production-grade stability. The following features have been recently added (we have also upstreamed most of them to slime):

### True On-Policy

Besides the existing determinist feature that the runs yield bitwise identical and repeatable results, we further support [true on-policy](https://github.com/THUDM/slime/tree/main/examples/true_on_policy) via the infrastructure approach.

- The mismatch between training and inference is reduced to exactly zero.
- To implement it, we use Flash Attention 3, DeepGEMM, batch invariant kernels from Thinking Machines Lab, and torch compile. We also align numeric operation details between training and inference.

### Memory Improvements

In order to fully utilize the precious GPU memory for maximum performance without encountering OOM errors, we made updates such as the following:

- Add propagation to avoid errors when benign OOM; implement memory margin to fix OOM from NCCL; fix FSDP excessive memory or OOM; support move-based and partial offloading; host peak memory saving.

### Speculative Training

In RL, freezing the draft model prevents it from following the target model policy, reducing accept length and degrading speedup, so we perform [online SFT on the draft model](https://github.com/zhaochenyang20/Awesome-ML-SYS-Tutorial/blob/main/rlhf/slime/spec/readme-en.md) throughout RL.

- Achieve 25%+ rollout speedup vs. frozen MTP, especially in the late training stage.
- Support MTP with sequence packing + CP; Loss masks with proper edge-case handling; LM head/embedding gradient isolation, and Megatron↔SGLang weight syncing.

### Miscellaneous Updates

Enhance the FSDP training backend; allow deploying the rollout subsystem independently outside the framework; debug utilities such as more metrics, post-hoc analyzers, and enhancing profilers; gradually refactor the code to further enhance it; A formal mathematics (Lean) example is provided with [SFT/RL scripts](https://github.com/radixark/miles/tree/main/examples/formal_math/single_round).

## 🚧 Towards the Future: Our Roadmap

For the future development of Miles, we will put together more efforts to support enterprise-grade RL training. This includes:

- Large-scale MoE RL examples on new hardware, e.g., GB300.
- Multi-modal training
- Rollout accelerations
  - Compatible with SGLang spec v2 for better performance.
  - Advance speculative training support, like EAGLE3, multi-spec layer.
- Resource allocation for balanced training & serving in large-scale async training
- Elastic to GPU failures

## 🤝 Thanks towards Our Community

Miles exists thanks to the slime authors and the broader (SGLang) RL community.

We invite researchers, startups, and enterprise teams alike to explore slime and Miles - whichever best fits your environment - and to be together with us to make reinforcement learning efficient and reliable. We'll hear from the community and actively work on Miles' future development, towards a production-ready training environment.
