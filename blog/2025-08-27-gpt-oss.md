We are excited to announce a major update for SGLang, focusing on deep performance optimizations and new features for the recently released openai/gpt-oss-120b model. **While we had support from day zero, we took the last few weeks to enhance our engine to ensure you get the best possible performance.**

This post highlights our latest achievements: a significant performance improvement for gpt-oss with up to **2.1x** higher throughput on prefill and **2.25x** higher throughput on decode, out-of-the-box support for NVIDIA Blackwell & Hopper and AMD MI350 GPUs, and enhanced APIs to power complex agentic applications—all while maintaining the model's high accuracy.

All changes are now available in our main branch.

### Get Started with SGLang

```bash
pip install "sglang[all]>=0.5.2"
python3 -m sglang.launch_server --model-path openai/gpt-oss-120b --tp 4
```

For detailed instructions on environment setup and how to gain the best performance, please see our guide [here](https://github.com/sgl-project/awesome-sglang/tree/main/gpt-oss).

## By the Numbers: Comprehensive Benchmark Results 📊

To show the impact of our optimizations, we benchmarked SGLang across a range of hardware configurations. For all the results, the reproduction command can be found [here](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/tree/main/benchmark/gpt_oss).

##### Low-Latency Performance (Batch Size = 1)

For latency-sensitive applications, we measured single-batch decode throughput across NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, showcasing excellent performance.

| Hardware / Precision | NVIDIA B200  | NVIDIA H100  | AMD MI350    |
| -------------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| MXFP4                | 416.02 tok/s | 318.53 tok/s | 200.84 tok/s |
| BF16                 | 315.63 tok/s | 293.12 tok/s | 220.06 tok/s |

<span style="color: grey; font-size: 12px;">
B200 was tested with TP=4, H100 with TP=8 and triton attention, and MI350 with TP=8 and triton backend.

##### High-Throughput Performance (Batch Size = 32)

For high-throughput applications, SGLang delivers significant performance gains over our initial Day 0 support and have shown great performance on both prefill and decode on different hardwares.

## Performance Deep Dive 🚀

Our performance gains come from several key optimizations at the kernel level:

- **FlashInfer Kernels for Blackwell**: To unlock peak performance for gpt-oss on Blackwell GPUs, we integrated highly optimized kernels from FlashInfer. This accelerates core components, including multi-head attention and Mixture of Experts (MoE) layers, on the new hardware.
- **FlashAttention-3 for Hopper**: We modified the FlashAttention-3 kernels to support attention sinks, providing a significant speedup for inference on Hopper GPUs.
- **Kernel Fusion and Reduction**: We performed several low-level fusions to reduce overhead. This includes fusing the RMS norm with all-reduce, merging the set KV buffer operation into RoPE, and fusing hidden states padding into quantization. We also removed unnecessary kernels, enabled [PDL](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#programmatic-dependent-launch-and-synchronization) for some kernels, and reduced CPU overhead for greater efficiency.

## Accuracy Alignment with Official Report 🎯

We validated our optimized gpt-oss implementation against the GPQA benchmark and confirmed that our results align closely with the official model card, ensuring that these speedups do not compromise the model's reasoning capabilities.

## Powering Agentic Applications 🤖

To better enable agentic workflows, SGLang now offers [OpenAI Reponse API support](https://docs.sglang.ai/basic_usage/gpt_oss.html#responses-api) and [native chat completion support](https://docs.sglang.ai/advanced_features/function_calling.html#). Here is an example of how to build a simple web search agent with SGLang.

Launch the server:

```bash
export EXA_API_KEY=YOUR_EXA_KEY
python3 -m sglang.launch_server --port 30000 --model-path openai/gpt-oss-120b --tp 4 --tool-server demo 
```

Use Response API to build a web search agent:

```python
import openai

client = openai.OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:30000/v1",
    api_key="EMPTY"
)
response = client.responses.create(
    model="openai/gpt-oss-120b",
    tools=[{"type": "web_search_preview"}],
    input="What does SGLang update today?"
)

print(response.output_text)
```
