We’re excited to share that Chatbot Arena now has its own dedicated website: [lmarena.ai](https://lmarena.ai) and [blog](https://blog.lmarena.ai)!

You might be wondering why we’re making this change. Over the past year, with the incredible support of our community, Chatbot Arena has evolved into a mature ecosystem and platform. We believe it’s time for it to **graduate** and stand on its own. By giving Chatbot Arena its own platform, we aim to provide it with more independence and ensure its long-term growth.

From day one, LMSys has been a research collective dedicated to a variety of projects, such as [Vicuna](https://lmsys.org/blog/2023-03-30-vicuna/), [Chatbot Arena](https://lmarena.ai), [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang), [S-LoRA](https://lmsys.org/blog/2023-11-15-slora/), [RouteLLM](https://lmsys.org/blog/2024-07-01-routellm/), and more — beyond just one initiative. Moving forward, LMSys will continue to serve as an incubator for new projects and as a platform for open research and development.

On the new Chatbot Arena site, you’ll find the latest updates and blog posts. Importantly, Chatbot Arena will remain a close partner with LMSys. Looking ahead, we’re expanding the platform to evaluate frontier models, not only for chatbots but also in areas like coding, complex tasks, and red-teaming. Together, we are committed to advancing open systems and model evaluation.

Thank you for being a part of this journey with us. We’re excited for what’s ahead and appreciate your continued support!

Cheers,  
The LMSys Team
