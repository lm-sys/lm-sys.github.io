Speculative decoding is a powerful technique for accelerating Large Language Model (LLM) inference. In this blog post, we are excited to announce the open-sourcing of **SpecForge**, our new training framework for Eagle3-based speculative decoding. SpecForge is designed for ease of use and is tightly integrated with the **SGLang** inference engine, enabling a seamless transition from training to deployment.

## Why a New Speculative Decoding Training Framework

While speculative decoding has emerged as a breakthrough for accelerating LLM inference, the lack of robust open-source tools for training draft models‚Äîa key component of this process‚Äîhas significantly hindered its adoption. Many existing Eagle3-based projects suffer from poor maintenance, limited functionality, or lack of compatibility with frameworks like SGLang. These limitations have become significant barriers to adoption and practical deployment.

To bridge the gap between research and deployment, we built **SpecForge**‚Äîa purpose-built ecosystem for training draft models that integrate natively with SGLang. As soon as training completes, models are ready for inference out of the box‚Äîno further adaptation needed. Meanwhile, training effective draft models for today‚Äôs frontier LLMs‚Äîsuch as Llama 4, DeepSeek, and other Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models‚Äîrequires infrastructure that can handle their complexity and scale. SpecForge is purpose-built from the ground up to meet these demands, bridging the gap between cutting-edge research and real-world deployment.

Key Capabilities of SpecForge:

-   **Native Support for Advanced Architectures**: SpecForge supports cutting-edge models, including complex MoE layers and transformer variants.
-   **Scalable Distributed Training**: Integrated with modern large-scale training strategies like Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) and Tensor Parallelism (TP), SpecForge allows efficient scaling across GPU clusters.
-   **Memory-Efficient Training**: Optimized memory management techniques make it feasible to train draft models even for very large base models.

## SpecForge Key Features

### Eagle3 Integration

Eagle is a state-of-the-art method for speculative decoding designed to accelerate large language model inference. It achieves this by training a specialized, lightweight draft model to accurately predict the token distributions of a larger target model, leading to high acceptance rates and significant performance improvements.

#### Training-time Test Support

This high performance is largely driven by Eagle's novel Training-Time Test (TTT) architecture, which makes the draft model robust by simulating multi-step generation. Despite its power, TTT is notoriously difficult to implement due to its use of specialized attention masks and recursive data loops. SpecForge simplifies this complexity by providing built-in TTT support, referencing the official Eagle3 implementation to ensure correctness and optimal performance.

### Two Training Modes: Online and Offline

SpecForge simplifies hidden state collection by offering two versatile modes for training: **Online** and **Offline**. This two modes design ensures flexibility across workflows, regardless of your model access rights or hardware limitations.

| Method  | Target Model                      | Disk Space Requirement                            | GPU Requirement                                              | One-liner rationale                                        |
| ------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Online  | Used during training              | Small                                             | More GPUs are needed if your target model is large           | Generating auxiliary hidden states on the fly              |
| Offline | Only used during data preparation | Huge (e.g. ultrachat+sharegpt need 12TB storage ) | as low as 1 GPU, since only the draft model needs to be accommodated | Preparing auxiliary hidden states beforehand and only once |

SpecForge allows you to tailor the training process to your specific needs. Choose Online Mode for agility and minimal disk usage‚Äîideal for rapid iteration. Choose Offline Mode when reproducibility and data reuse are key priorities, provided sufficient storage is available.

### Prioritizing Extensibility and Scalability

Our framework is designed with a strong emphasis on extensibility and scalability to meet engineering production requirements. We enable straightforward implementation and registration of new draft & target models through a modular interface.

To support large-scale models, SpecForge leverages PyTorch‚Äôs FSDP and integrates tensor parallelism, ensuring efficient training across multi-GPU clusters.

## Experiments

Using SpecForge, we trained the Llama 4 Scout and Maverick models on a 320K-sample dataset from ShareGPT and UltraChat. The models' strong performance on benchmarks like MT-Bench demonstrates their effectiveness and readiness for Eagle3 inference. Our Llama 4 Maverick draft model achieves a 2.18√ó speedup on MT-Bench, while the Scout variant delivers a 2.0√ó acceleration‚Äîdemonstrating SpecForge‚Äôs performance gains across model variants. Detailed results are summarized below.

We evaluated various draft token lengths for Scout and Maverick. 

In all the tests shown in the figure below, the x-axis represents steps, corresponding to speculative-num-steps in SGLang. Meanwhile, we fixed SGLang's speculative-eagle-topk to 8 and speculative-num-draft-tokens to 10 to ensure that tree attention can be enabled.
