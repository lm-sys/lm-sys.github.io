\nmeanwhile, several notable models have been released claiming to support much longer context than LLaMA, notable ones include:\n- [MPT-7B-storywriter](https://huggingface.co/mosaicml/mpt-7b-storywriter) supports 65K context length and extrapolates to 84K. \n- [MPT-30B-chat](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mosaicml/mpt-30b-chat) supports 8K context length.\n- [ChatGLM2-6B](https://huggingface.co/THUDM/chatglm2-6b) supports 8K context.\n\nAt LMSYS Org, we have been concurrently exploring various techniques to lengthen the context of our models like [Vicuna](https://huggingface.co/lmsys/vicuna-13b-v1.3). \nIn this blogpost, alongside the release of the LongChat series, we share our [evaluation tools](https://github.com/DachengLi1/LongChat) to verify the long-context capability of LLMs. \n\nUsing our evaluation tools in combination with various academic long-context evaluation benchmarks, we conduct a thorough comparison of several open-source and commercial models that claim to support long context. \nThrough this analysis, we examine how well these models deliver on their promised context length.\nWe found that *while commercial models like GPT-3.5-turbo performs well on our tests, many open source models do not deliver the expected results on their promised context length*.\n\nThe data and code used to reproduce the results in the blog post are available in our LongChat [repo](https://github.com/DachengLi1/LongChat/tree/longeval). \nWe provide a visualization in this [notebook](https://github.com/DachengLi1/LongChat/blob/longeval/longeval/topics_lines_demo.ipynb).\n\n## LongChat Training Recipe\n\nLongChat is finetuned from LLaMA models, which were originally pretrained with 2048 context length. \nThe training recipe can be conceptually described in two steps:\n\n### Step 1: Condensing rotary embeddings\n[Rotary position embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09864v4) is a type of positional embedding that injects the information of position in Transformer. \nIt is implemented in Hugging Face transformer by:\n```python\nquery_states, key_states = apply_rotary_pos_emb(query_states, key_states, cos, sin, position_ids)\n```\nWhere position_ids are indices such as 1, 2, 3, ... that denote the position of a token in the sentence. \nFor instance, the token \"today\" in the sentence \"today is a good day\" has position_ids 1. \nThe `apply_rotary_pos_emb()` function then applies a [transformation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.09864.pdf) based on the provided position_ids.\n\nThe LLaMA model is pre-trained with rotary embedding on sequence length 2048, which means that it has not observed scenarios where position_ids > 2048 during the pre-training phase. \nInstead of forcing the LLaMA model to adapt to position_ids > 2048, we condense position_ids > 2048 to be within 0 to 2048. \nIntuitively, we conjecture this condensation can maximally reuse the model weights learned in the pre-training stage. See more insights from [Kaiokendev’s blog](https://kaiokendev.github.io/context).\n\nWe define the term `condensation ratio` by dividing the target new context length `y` by 2048. We then divide every position_ids by this ratio and feed it into the `apply_rotary_pos_emb()` function.\n```python\nquery_states, key_states = apply_rotary_pos_emb(query_states, key_states, cos, sin, position_ids / ratio)\n```\nIn this release, we fine-tune the model to a context length of 16384, and thus the condensation ratio is 8. For instance, a token with position_ids = 10000 becomes position_ids = 10000 / 8 = 1250, and the neighboring token 10001 becomes 10001 / 8 = 1250.125. \nThis step requires no training.\n\n### Step 2: Finetuning on Curated Conversation Data\nAfter condensing the embedding, we perform the finetuning procedure on our curated conversation dataset. \nWe reuse our collected user-shared conversations previously used for training Vicuna. \nWe clean the data using FastChat data pipeline, and truncate these conversations so they are no longer than 16K. \nWe finetune the model using standard next-token prediction loss. We fine-tune the 7B and 13B models with 80k and 18k conversations, respectively. \nTo save memory, we use Pytorch FSDP and Flash Attention. Assume A100 is $3/hour on Cloud, the 7B model costs ~$300, and the 13B model costs ~$700. \n\n## Evaluation toolkits: LongEval\nRecently, commercial and open-source models have continued to tout their abilities to support expanded context length (from 8K, 32K, 84K, to 100K) in their latest releases, but how can we verify these claims?\nThe term \"long-context capability\" can mean different things for different model providers. For instance, does [MPT-7B-StoryWriter's](https://huggingface.co/mosaicml/mpt-7b-storywriter) advertised 84K context length operate at the same capacity as OpenAI’s ChatGPT at 16K? \nThis issue is also prevalent in our LongChat models development: how do we swiftly and effectively confirm if a freshly trained model can handle the intended context length?\n\nTo address this, we can base our evaluations on tasks that necessitate LLMs to process lengthy contexts, such as text generation, retrieval, summarization, and information association in long text sequences. \nInspired by [recent discussions](https://twitter.com/DimitrisPapail/status/1658091355632189440), we've devised, [LongEval](https://github.com/DachengLi1/LongChat.git), a long context test suite. \nThis suite incorporates two tasks of varying degrees of difficulty, providing a simple and swift way to measure and compare long-context performance.\n\n### Task 1: Coarse-grained Topic Retrieval\nIn real-world long conversations, users usually talk about and jump between several topics with the chatbot. The Topic Retrieval task mimics this scenario by asking the chatbot to retrieve the first topic in a long conversation consisting of multiple topics. An example task is:\n```python\n… (instruction of the task)\nUSER: I would like to discuss <TOPIC-1>\nASSISTANT: Sure! What about xxx of <TOPIC-1>?\n… (a multi-turn conversation of <TOPIC-1>)\nUSER: I would like to discuss  <TOPIC-2>\n…\nUSER: I would like to discuss <TOPIC-k>\n… \nUSER: What is the first topic we discussed?\nASSISTANT: \n```\nThis task tests whether the model can locate a chunk of text and associate it with the right topic name. We design a conversation to be 400 ~ 600 tokens long. Thus, this task is considered coarse-grained because the model may give correct predictions when it locates positions not too far away (<500 token distance) from the right ones.\n\n### Task 2: Fine-grained Line Retrieval\nTo further test the model ability to locate and associate texts from a long conversation, we introduce a finer-grained Line Retrieval test. In this test, the chatbot needs to precisely retrieve a number from a long document, instead of a topic from long multi-round conversations. Below is an example:\n```python\nline torpid-kid: REGISTER_CONTENT is <24169>\nline moaning-conversation: REGISTER_CONTENT is <10310>\n…\nline tacit-colonial: REGISTER_CONTENT is <14564>\nWhat is the <REGISTER_CONTENT> in line moaning-conversation?\n```\n\nThe task was originally proposed in [Little Retrieval Test](https://github.com/anadim/the-little-retrieval-test). \nThe original testcase uses numbers to denote a line, which we found smaller LLMs usually cannot comprehend well. \nTo disentangle these factors and make them more suitable for testing open-source chatbots at various sizes, we improve it by using random natural language (e.g., torpid-kid) instead.\n\nWe found these two tasks behave with the expected characteristics:\n1. The task can effectively capture the abilities of text generation, retrieval, and information association at long context, reflected by the retrieving accuracy.\n2. It is easy to extend the tests to arbitrary lengths to test models’ capacity under different context lengths.\n3. We have run sanity checks of both tasks and observed the expected results. For example, the vanilla LLaMA models, pretrained with a 2K context length, can achieve perfect accuracy on both tasks when the test inputs length is <2K, but will immediately fail (nearly 0 accuracy) on any test inputs beyond 2K.\n\nMore details and example usage of LongEval can be found in this [notebook](https://github.com/DachengLi1/LongChat/blob/longeval/longeval/topics_lines_demo.ipynb).\n\n\n## Results and findings\nIn this section, we share our evaluation and findings.\n<br>\n<p style=\"color:gray; text-align: center;\">Table 1.

For instance, Mpt-7b-storywriter claims to have a context length of 84K but barely achieves 50% accuracy even at one-fifth of its claimed context length (16K). \nchatglm2-6B cannot reliably retrieve the first topic at the length of 6K (46% accuracy). On the other hand, we observed that our LongChat-13B-16K model reliably retrieves the first topic, with comparable accuracy to gpt-3.5-turbo.\n\n<img src=\"/images/blog/longchat/line_retrieval.png\" style=\"display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 1000px;\"></img>\n<p style=\"color:gray; text-align: center;\">Figure 3: Accuracy on the long-range line retrieval task.</p>\n\nIn the finer-grained line retrieval test, Mpt-7b-storywriter performs even worse than in the coarse-grained cases, dropping accuracy from ~50% to ~30%. Chatglm2-6B also observes degradation and does not perform well at 5K context length (32%). We notice that ChatGLM2-6B states that it has not been yet fully optimized for single-turn long document understanding, which could explain its current weak performance on LongEval. In contrast, we observe that LongChat-13B-16K performs reliably, achieving near gpt-3.5/Anthropic-claude ability within 12K context length (we also find the preview version is not perfect at 12K-16K, see discussion section).\n\n\n**Disentangle irrelevant LLM abilities in LongEval**\n\nIn topics and line retrieval tests, we observe mistakes caused by factors irrelevant to long-context ability, such as the instruction-following ability. For instance, in the Line Retrieval test, the model may simply respond “sure, I will tell you the number” instead of returning an actual number. To give a fair comparison, we took two actions to avoid factors irrelevant to long-context capability: prompt engineering and compute accuracy based only on the cases where the model follows our instruction. Check our codes for details.\n\n### Human preference benchmark (MT-bench)\nIn the previous section, we observed that LongChat models perform well on long-range retrieval tasks, but does this come with a significant drop in human preference? To test whether it still follows human preferences, we use GPT-4 graded [MT-bench](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat/tree/main/fastchat/llm_judge), a set of challenging multi-turn conversation questions.\n\n<p style=\"color:gray; text-align: center;\">Table 2. MT-bench scores comparing LongChat-13B to other models of similar sizes.</p>\n<table id=\"Table1\" style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\" align=\"left\" >\n<tbody>\n<tr> <th>Model</th> <th>MT-bench (score)</th></tr>\n<tr> <td><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://huggingface.co/lmsys/longchat-13b-16k\">LongChat-13B-16K</a></td>  <td>5.95</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://huggingface.co/lmsys/vicuna-13b-v1.3\">Vicuna-13B </a></td>  <td>6.39</td>  </tr>\n<tr> <td><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://huggingface.co/WizardLM/WizardLM-13B-V1.0\"> WizardLM-13B</a></td>  <td>6.35</td>  </tr>\n<tr> <td><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://huggingface.co/project-baize/baize-v2-13b\"> Baize-v2-13B </a></td>  <td>5.75</td>  </tr>\n<tr> <td><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://huggingface.co/NousResearch/Nous-Hermes-13b\"> Nous-Hermes-13B </a></td>  <td>5.51</td>   </tr>\n<tr> <td><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/03/13/alpaca.html\"> Alpaca-13B</a></td>  <td>4.53</td>  </tr>\n\n\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\nWe find that LongChat-13B-16K is comparable to its closest alternative - Vicuna-13B, which indicates that this long-range ability does not come with a significant sacrifice of its short-range ability. At the same time, LongChat-13B-16K is competitive compared to other models of the same size.\n&shy;\n\n### Long sequence question answer benchmark \nIn the previous sections, we tested models on our (simple) long-range retrieval tasks and human preference tasks. But how do these models perform on more complex academic long-range reasoning tasks?  In this section, we study this by running the Qasper question answering dataset. We use the validation set selection and prompts from the [ZeroScrolls](https://www.zero.scrolls-benchmark.com/) long sequence benchmark.\n\n<br>\n<p style=\"color:gray; text-align: center;\">Table 3. ZeroScrolls benchmark (validation set)</p>\n<table id=\"Table1\" style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\" align=\"left\" >\n<tbody>\n\n<tr> <th>Benchmark</th> <th>LongChat-13B-16K</th> <th>LongChat-7B-16k</th> <th>Vicuna-13B-v1.3</th> <th>Vicuna-7B-v1.3</th> <th>GPT-4-8k</th></tr>\n<tr> <td>Qasper (F1)</td>  <td>0.286</td> <td>0.275</td> <td>0.220</td> <td>0.190</td> <td>0.356</td> </tr>\n\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n&shy;\n\nWe find that LongChat significantly outperforms Vicuna due to its longer context length. We leave more rigorous analysis on academic benchmarks for future work.\n\n## Discussion\nWe find that LongChat-13B-16K experiences an accuracy drop when the context length is near 16K on the fine-grained line retrieval task. In our preliminary attempts, we conjecture that this is because it is near the maximal fine-tuning length. For instance, training on even larger (e.g., 32K) can alleviate this problem. We are actively working on solving this in a near-future release.\n\n## Conclusion\nIn our evaluations, commercial long-context models always fulfill their promise: gpt-3.5-16k and Anthropic Claude (almost) achieve perfect performance in both our benchmarks. However, existing open-sourced models often do not perform well in the claimed context-length - in fact, usually a much smaller context length.\n\n<br>\n<p style=\"color:gray; text-align: center;\">Table 4.

For instance, techniques such as Flash Attention enables model to be served in a much longer sequence length. However, the model provider needs to train the model well(e.g. with high-quality longer sequence data, or perform condensing as we explored) to perform good long-context text-generation, retrieval, and resoning ability. We call for the community to contribute to more evaluation benchmarks of long-context chatbots and further understand/bridge the gap. \n\n## Next Steps\nInspired by the promising performance and the simple training recipe of our 16K models, we would like to explore even longer chatbot models. We have observed many efficiency issues (e.g. memory and throughput) during training and inference using chatbots with much longer context length. \nWe plan to develop new system technologies to improve LLMs' performance at long context.\n\n## Disclaimer\nThe benchmark LongEval introduced in this blogpost is not yet a comprehensive benchmark that should be used as the only indicator. \nWe are actively working on more systematic benchmarking.\n\n## The Team\nThe LongChat models and this blog post are developed, evaluated, and maintained by the following members:\nDacheng Li*, Rulin Shao*, Anze Xie, Ying Sheng, Lianmin Zheng, Joseph E.

Please consider the results as guiding references. See our discussion below for more technical details.\n\n## Evaluating Chatbots with MT-bench and Arena\n\n### Motivation\n\nWhile several benchmarks exist for evaluating Large Language Model's (LLM) performance, such as [MMLU](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03300), [HellaSwag](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07830), and [HumanEval](https://github.com/openai/human-eval), \nwe noticed that these benchmarks might fall short when assessing LLMs' human preferences. \nTraditional benchmarks often test LLMs on close-ended questions with concise outputs (e.g., multiple choices), which do not reflect the typical use cases of LLM-based chat assistants.\n\nTo fill this gap, in this leaderboard update, in addition to the Chatbot Arena Elo system, we add a new benchmark: MT-Bench.\n- [MT-bench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05685) is a challenging multi-turn question set designed to evaluate the conversational and instruction-following ability of models. You can view sample questions and answers of MT-bench [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmsys/mt-bench).\n- [Chatbot Arena](https://chat.lmsys.org/?arena) is a crowd-sourced battle platform, where users ask chatbots any question and vote for their preferred answer.\n\nBoth benchmarks are designed to use human preferences as the primary metric.\n\n### Why MT-Bench?\n\nMT-Bench is a carefully curated benchmark that includes 80 high-quality, multi-turn questions. \nThese questions are tailored to assess the conversation flow and instruction-following capabilities of models in multi-turn dialogues. \nThey include both common use cases and challenging instructions meant to distinguish between chatbots. \nMT-Bench serves as a **quality-controlled complement** to our crowd-sourced based evaluation -- Chatbot Arena.\n\nThrough running the Chatbot Arena for 2 months and analyzing our users' prompts, we've identified 8 primary categories of user prompts: Writing, Roleplay, Extraction, Reasoning, Math, Coding, Knowledge I (STEM), and Knowledge II (humanities/social science). \nWe crafted 10 multi-turn questions per category, yielding a set of 160 questions in total. We display some sample questions below in Figure 1. You can find more [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmsys/mt-bench).\n\n<img src=\"/images/blog/leaderboard_week8/sample_question.png\" style=\"display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 1500px;\"></img>\n<p style=\"color:gray; text-align: center;\">Figure 1: Sample questions from the MT-Bench.</p>\n\n### But Still, How to Grade Chatbots' Answers?\nThough we believe human preference is the gold standard, it is notoriously slow and expensive to collect. \nIn our first [Vicuna blogpost](https://lmsys.org/blog/2023-03-30-vicuna/), we explored an automated evaluation pipeline based on GPT-4. \nThis approach has since got popular and adopted in several [concurrent and follow-up works](#related-work).\n\nIn our latest paper, [\"Judging LLM-as-a-judge\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05685), we conducted a systematic study to answer how reliable those LLM judges are. \nWe provide a brief overview of conclusions here but recommend reading the paper for more details.\n\nWe begin by acknowledging potential limitations of LLM-as-a-judge:\n\n- **Position bias** where LLM judges may favor the first answer in a pairwise comparison.\n- **Verbosity bias** where LLM judges may favor lengthier answers, regardless of their quality.\n- **Self-enhancement bias** where LLM judges may favor their own responses.\n- **Limited reasoning ability** referring to LLM judges' possible shortcomings in grading math and reasoning questions.\n\nOur study then explores how few-shot judge, chain-of-thought judge, reference-based judge, and fine-tuned judge can help to mitigate these limitations.\n\nUpon implementing some of these solutions, we discovered that despite limitations, strong LLM judges like GPT-4 can align impressively well with both controlled and crowdsourced human preferences, achieving over 80% agreement. \nThis level of agreement is comparable to the agreement between two different human judges. \nTherefore, if used carefully, LLM-as-a-judge can act as a *scalable* and *explainable* approximation of human preferences.\n\nWe also found that single-answer grading based on GPT-4, without pairwise comparison, can also rank models effectively and match human preferences well. \nIn Table 1, we present the MT-Bench as a column on the leaderboard based on single-answer grading with GPT-4.\n\n## Results and Analysis\n\n### MT-Bench Effectively Distinguishes Among Chatbots\n\nTable 1 provides a detailed rundown of the MT-bench-enhanced leaderboard, where we conduct an exhaustive evaluation of 28 popular instruction-tuned models. \nWe observe a clear distinction among chatbots of varying abilities, with scores showing a high correlation with the Chatbot Arena Elo rating. \nIn particular, MT-Bench reveals noticeable performance gaps between GPT-4 and GPT-3.5/Claude, and between open and proprietary models.\n\nTo delve deeper into the distinguishing factors among chatbots, we select a few representative chatbots and break down their performance per category in Figure 2. \nGPT-4 shows superior performance in Coding and Reasoning compared to GPT-3.5/Claude, while Vicuna-13B lags significantly behind in several specific categories: Extraction, Coding, and Math. \nThis suggests there is still ample room for improvement for open-source models.\n\n<img src=\"/images/blog/leaderboard_week8/ability_breakdown.png\" style=\"display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 1000px;\"></img>\n<p style=\"color:gray; text-align: center;\">Figure 2: The comparison of 6 representative LLMs regarding their abilities in 8 categories: Writing, Roleplay, Reasoning, Math, Coding, Extraction, STEM, Humanities.</p>\n\n\n### Multi-turn Conversation Capabilities\n\nWe next analyze the multi-turn scores of selected models, presented in Table 2. \n\n<br>\n<p style=\"color:gray; text-align: center;\">Table 2.

It can still make errors, especially when grading math/reasoning questions.\n\n\n## How to Evaluate New Models on MT-Bench?\n\nEvaluating models on MT-bench is simple and fast. Our script supports all huggingface models, and we’ve provided [detailed instructions](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat/tree/main/fastchat/llm_judge#mt-bench), \nin which you can generate model’s answers to the MT-bench questions and their GPT-4 judgments. You can also examine the answers and reviews on our gradio browsing demo.\n\n## Next steps\n**Release of Conversations Data**\n\nWe're in the process of releasing Chatbot Arena conversations data to the broader research community.

[FastChat](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat)'s OpenAI-compatible API server enables this seamless transition.\r\nIn this blog post, we show how you can do this and use LangChain as an [example](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat/blob/main/docs/langchain_integration.md).\r\n\r\n\r\n## **Demo: LangChain with Vicuna-13B**\r\n\r\nHere, we present two demos of using LangChain with [Vicuna-13B](http://ec2-52-40-36-154.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/blog/2023-03-30-vicuna/), a state-of-the-art open model.\r\n\r\n1. Question answering over docs  \r\n  Enliven your documents, and communicate with them through a single command line ([doc](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/question_answering.html)).\r\n\r\n<img src=\"/images/blog/langchain/qa_demo.png\" style=\"display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto;\"></img>\r\n\r\n2. Code understanding  \r\n  Clone the llama repository and then understand the code with a single command line, bringing your code to life ([doc](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/code.html)).\r\n\r\n<img src=\"/images/blog/langchain/code_analysis.png\" style=\"display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto;\"></img>\r\n\r\nThe demos above are implemented directly with default LangChain code.\r\nThey don't require you to adapt specifically for Vicuna. Any tool implemented with the OpenAI API can be seamlessly migrated to the open models through FastChat.\r\n\r\n## **Why Local API Server?**\r\n\r\n**Data Privacy**: When using FastChat's OpenAI-compatible API server and LangChain, all the data and interactions remain on your local machine. This means you have full control over your data, and it never leaves your local environment unless you decide to share it. This local setup ensures that sensitive data isn't exposed to third-party services, reducing the risk of data breaches and ensuring compliance with data privacy regulations.\r\n\r\n**Cost Saving**: Traditional cloud-based API services often charge based on the number of requests or the tokens used. These costs can add up quickly, especially for researchers, organizations and companies. By running models locally, you can fully harness the power of large AI models without the worry of accumulating costs from API.\r\n\r\n**Customizability**: With a local setup, you have the freedom to adapt the AI model to suit your specific needs. You can experiment with different parameters, settings, or even adjust the model architecture itself. More importantly, it allows you the opportunity to fine-tune the model for certain specific behaviors. This capability gives you control not only over how the model operates but also over the quality and relevance of the output.\r\n\r\n## **Local OpenAI API Server with FastChat**\r\n\r\nFastChat API server can interface with apps based on the OpenAI API through the OpenAI API protocol. This means that the open models can be used as a replacement without any need for code modification.\r\nThe figure below shows the overall architecture.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"/images/blog/langchain/overview.png\" style=\"display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto;\"></img>\r\n\r\nHow to integrate a local model into FastChat API server? All you need to do is giving the model an OpenAI model name when launching it. See [LangChain Support](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat/blob/main/docs/langchain_integration.md) for details.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"/images/blog/langchain/launch_api.png\" style=\"display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto;\"></img>\r\n\r\nThe API server is compatible with both curl and [OpenAI python package](https://github.com/openai/openai-python). It supports chat completions, completions, embeddings, and more.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"/images/blog/langchain/curl_request.png\" style=\"display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto;\"></img>\r\n\r\n\r\n## **Comparing Vicuna-13B, MPT-Chat-7B, and OpenAI for using LangChain**\r\n\r\nWe have conducted some preliminary testing on the open models performing LangChain tasks. These initial tests are relatively simple, including text-based question answering tasks and salesman agent performance tasks.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Question Answering over Docs\r\n\r\nText-based question answering assesses the model's natural language understanding and generation abilities, and its grasp of common knowledge. We selected the transcript from the 2022 State of the Union address by President Biden as the document for querying. Six questions were posed to the model, each of which had its answer directly found within the text of the document. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"/images/blog/langchain/qa_table.png\" style=\"display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto;\"></img>\r\n\r\nIn terms of understanding the queries, all three models were successful. However, when it came to text retrieval ability, OpenAI demonstrated a clear advantage over Vicuna. This could very likely be attributed to the higher quality of OpenAI's embeddings, making it easier for the model to locate related contents.\r\n\r\n### Salesman Agent Performance\r\n\r\nTo further evaluate the models' interaction capabilities, we implemented an approach by having the models take on the role of a salesman through LangChain. We posed several questions and invited GPT-4 to rate the quality of the responses provided by the different models.\r\n\r\nThis test offers insights into the quality of text generation and the ability to portray a convincing agent role, aspects that are of utmost importance within LangChain. The 'salesman' scenario is a robust way to understand how effectively a model can engage in complex dialogue, showcasing its ability to respond appropriately and convincingly in a specific role. The scoring criteria here also reflects the emphasis on quality, both in terms of coherence and the ability to effectively deliver on the task of playing the role of a 'salesman'.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Sales Agent\r\n\r\nWe executed [SalesGPT](https://github.com/filip-michalsky/SalesGPT) tasks with open models and gpt-3.5-turbo. Below is the initialization code for SalesGPT.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"/images/blog/langchain/sales_agent.png\" style=\"display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto;\"></img>\r\n\r\n#### GPT4 evaluation\r\n\r\nWe posed three questions to the salesman and then let GPT-4 grade and evaluate them.\r\n\r\n1. **Vicuna**:\r\n    * Answer 1: 9/10 - Comprehensive and clear, emphasizing the company's mission and values.\r\n    * Answer 2: 9/10 - Good explanation of the unique selling proposition, but could be more explicit in differentiating from competitors.\r\n    * Answer 3: 10/10 - Provides detailed product information, including environmental friendliness and hypoallergenic properties.\r\n    * Total Score: 28/30\r\n2. **GPT-3.5-turbo**:\r\n    * Answer 1: 8/10 - Concise, but does not expand on the company's mission and values.\r\n    * Answer 2: 8/10 - Repeats previous information, does not detail the differences from competitors.\r\n    * Answer 3: 10/10 - Provides detailed product information, focusing on environmental friendliness and hypoallergenic properties.\r\n    * Total Score: 26/30\r\n3. **MPT**:\r\n    * Answer 1: 8/10 - Clear and succinct, but does not delve into the company's mission and values.\r\n    * Answer 2: 8/10 - Lacks clarity on company specifics and fails to differentiate from competitors.\r\n    * Answer 3: 9/10 - Provides detailed product information, but not as explicit on the environmental friendliness and hypoallergenic properties as the other two.\r\n    * Total Score: 25/30\r\n\r\nThe Salesman test provided interesting insights into the conversational and agent capabilities of the three models: Vicuna, GPT-3.5-turbo, and MPT. Vicuna model, performed exceptionally well, earning a total score of 28 out of 30.In this particular task, the open models and GPT-3.5-turbo didn't show significant differences, suggesting that open models can serve as a viable alternative to GPT-3.5-turbo.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it's important to note that for complex tasks, there is still a gap between open models and OpenAI models. For simpler tasks, open models can already do well. For privacy considerations and cost savings, simpler tasks can be accomplished by deploying the open model locally with FastChat.\r\n\r\n\r\n## **Acknowledgment**\r\n\r\nThe OpenAI-compatible API server is primarily contributed by Shuo Yang, Siyuan Zhuang, and Xia Han.\r\n","date":1686268800000},{"slug":"2023-05-25-leaderboard","frontmatter":{"title":"Chatbot Arena Leaderboard Updates (Week 4)","author":"LMSYS Org","date":"May 25, 2023","previewImg":"/images/blog/leaderboard_week4/leaderboard_cover.png"},"content":"\nIn this update, we are excited to welcome the following models joining the [Chatbot Arena](https://lmsys.org/blog/2023-05-03-arena/):\n\n1.

We added the PaLM 2 Chat to the Chatbot Arena via the [Google Cloud Vertex AI API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/release-notes#May_10_2023). The model is chat-tuned under the code name *chat-bison@001*.\n\nIn the past two weeks, PaLM 2 has competed for around 1.8k anonymous battles with the other 16 chatbots, currently ranked 6th on the leaderboard. It ranks above all other open-source chatbots, except for Vicuna-13B, whose Elo is 12 scores higher than PaLM 2 (Vicuna 1054 vs. PaLM 2 1042) which in terms of ELO rating is nearly a virtual tie. We noted the following interesting results from PaLM 2's Arena data.\n\nPaLM 2 is better when playing against the top 4 players, i.e., GPT-4, Claude-v1, ChatGPT, Claude-instant-v1, and it also wins 53% of the plays with Vicuna, but worse when playing against weaker players. This can be seen in Figure 1 which shows the win fraction matrix. Among all battles PaLM 2 has participated in, 21.6% were lost to a chatbot that is not one of GPT-4, Claude-v1, GPT-3.5-turbo, Claude-instant-v1. For reference, another proprietary model GPT-3.5-turbo only loses 12.8% of battles to those chatbots.\n\nIn short, we find that the current PaLM 2 version available at Google Cloud Vertex API has the following deficiencies when compared to other models we have evaluated:\n\n1. PaLM 2 seems more strongly regulated than other models which impacts its ability to answer some questions.\n2. The currently offered PaLM 2 has limited multilingual abilities.\n3. The currently offered PaLM 2 has unsatisfied reasoning capabilities.\n\n**PaLM 2 is more strongly regulated**\n\nPaLM 2 seems to be more strongly regulated than other models. In many user conversations, when the users ask questions that PaLM 2 is uncertain or uncomfortable giving an answer to, PaLM 2 is more likely to abstain from responding than other models. \n\nBased on a rough estimate, among all pairwise battles, PaLM 2 has lost 20.9% of the battles due to refusing to answer, and it has lost 30.8% of the battles to chatbots not belonging to one of the top four (GPT-4, Claude-v1, ChatGPT, Claude-instant-v1) due to refusing to answer.\n\nThis partially explains why PaLM 2 frequently loses plays to weaker chatbots on the leaderboard. This also highlights a flaw in the chatbot arena methodology, as casual users are more likely to penalize abstention over subtly inaccurate responses. Below we provide several failure cases illustrating how PaLM loses plays to weaker chatbots because it refuses to answer the question.\n\n\nWe also noticed that, sometimes, it is hard to clearly specify the boundary for LLM regulation. In the offered PaLM 2 versions, we see several undesired tendencies: \n - PaLM 2 refuses many roleplay questions, even if the users asked it to emulate a Linux terminal or a programming language interpreter.\n - Sometimes PaLM 2 refuses to answer easy and non-controversial factual questions. \n\nSeveral examples are shown below:\n\n<img src=\"/images/blog/leaderboard_week4/PaLM2_refusal_1.png\" style=\"display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto;\"></img>\n<img src=\"/images/blog/leaderboard_week4/PaLM2_refusal_2.png\" style=\"display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto;\"></img>\n<p style=\"color:gray; text-align: center;\">Figure 2: Example questions that PaLM 2 refuses to answer.</p>\n\n\n**Limited multilingual abilities**\n\nWe do not see strong multilingual abilities from PaLM 2 with the currently offered public API chat-bison@001 at Google Vertex API. PaLM 2 tends to not answer non-English questions, including questions written in popular languages such as Chinese, Spanish, and Hebrew. We were unable to reproduce several multilingual examples demonstrated in the PaLM 2 technical report using the current PaLM 2 versions. We are waiting for Google to gradually release the latest version of PaLM 2. \n\nWe also calculate the Elo ratings of all models when only considering English and only considering non-English conversations, respectively, illustrated in Figure 3. The results confirm the observations – on the non-English leaderboard, PaLM 2 ranks 16th.\n\n<img src=\"/images/blog/leaderboard_week4/language_leaderboard.png\" style=\"display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto;\"></img>\n<p style=\"color:gray; text-align: center;\">Figure 3: The English-only and non-English leaderboards.</p>\n\n\n**PaLM 2's reasoning ability is unsatisfied**\n\nWe also observe the offered PaLM 2 version do not demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities. On one hand, it seems to detect if the question is in plain text, and tends to refuse many questions not in plain text, such as those in programming languages, debugging, and code interpretation. On the other hand, we see PaLM 2 didn’t perform well on some entry-level reasoning tasks when compared against other chatbots. See several examples in Figure 4.\n\n<img src=\"/images/blog/leaderboard_week4/PaLM2_reasoning_1.png\" style=\"display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto;\"></img>\n<img src=\"/images/blog/leaderboard_week4/PaLM2_reasoning_2.png\" style=\"display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto;\"></img>\n<p style=\"color:gray; text-align: center;\">Figure 4: Examples where PaLM 2 fails on simple reasoning tasks.</p>\n\n\n**Elo ratings after removing non-English and refusal conversations**\n\nWe remove all non-English conversations and all conversations for which PaLM 2 didn’t provide an answer and calculate the Elo ratings of each model with the filtered data. This rating represents a hypothetical upper bound of PaLM 2's Elo in the Arena. See Figure 5 below.\n\n<img src=\"/images/blog/leaderboard_week4/english_non_refusal_leaderboard.png\" style=\"display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 500px;\"></img>\n<p style=\"color:gray; text-align: center;\">Figure 5: The leaderboard after removing PaLM 2's non-English and refusal conversations.</p>\n\n### Smaller Models Are Competitive\n\nWe observe several smaller models, including vicuna-7B and mpt-7b-chat, have achieved high ratings on the leaderboard. These smaller models perform favorably when compared against larger models with doubled parameters. \n\nWe speculate that high-quality pre-training and fine-tuning datasets are more critical than model size. However, it is possible that larger models would still perform better with more complex reasoning tasks or answering more subtle questions (e.g., Trivia).\nHence, curating high-quality datasets in both pretraining and finetuning stages seems to be a key approach to reducing model sizes while keeping model quality high.\n\n\n### Claude-v1 and Claude-instant-v1\nClaude-instant-v1 is a low-cost, faster alternative to Claude-v1 offered by Anthropic. If benchmarked in the wild in the arena, we observe that Claude-instant is close to GPT-3.5-turbo (1153 vs. 1143). The rating gap between Claude and Claude-instant seems smaller than that between GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo. Claude-instant has a context length of 9K, is charged at a price of 0.00163/1K prompt token and 0.00551/1K completion token, compared to its OpenAI opponent product – GPT-3.5-turbo – with a context length of 4K and a uniform price of 0.002/1K token (regardless of prompt or completion).\n\n### Limitations of the “In-the-wild” Evaluation\nHowever, we want to point out a few facts about the current chatbot Arena and leaderboard. The current Arena is designed to benchmark LLM-based chatbots **\"in the wild\"**. That means, the voting data provided by our Arena users and the prompts-answers generated during the voting process reflect how the chatbots perform in normal human-chatbot interactions. This might not align with many benchmarking results in the LLM research literature, which tends to characterize long-tail abilities like zero-shot, complex reasoning, etc. Hence, the current chatbot arena has limitations in clearly reflecting the long-tail capability difference between chatbots. See the later section for more details and our plan.\n\n\n## Next Steps\n**Evaluating long-tail capability of LLMs**\n\nAs pointed out by the community in [thread 1](https://twitter.com/tinkerteller/status/1656914923316998144?s=20) and [thread 2](https://twitter.com/LechMazur/status/1659915936919347202?s=20), the current Arena and leaderboard design has one major limitation: Performing user studies on a small scale often cannot generate many hard or medium prompts that are necessary to tell the long-tail capability difference between LLMs. Moreover, for difficult questions, it is also very hard for regular Arena users to judge which LLM has generated a better answer -- some domain-specific questions are considered very difficult, even for 99% of non-expert humans.\n\nHowever, long-tail capability, such as complex reasoning, can be crucial for LLMs to complete real-world tasks. Building long-tail capability into LLMs is the holy-grail problem and is the most actively studied and invested area in LLM development.\n\nWe listen carefully to the community feedback and are thinking about how to improve the leaderboard to overcome these limitations and capture the long-tail capability different in LLMs. On top of the Chatbot Arena, we are actively designing a new tournament mechanism to examine the chatbots using presets of expert-designed questions and expert judges. We will have more updates soon.\n\n**More models**\n\nSince the launch of Arena, we have received many requests from the community to add more models. Due to the limited compute resources and bandwidth we have, we may not be able to serve all of them.

Looking at the rankings and data collected from this leaderboard update, we have a few interesting findings.\n\n**Gaps between proprietary and open-source models**  \nWe do observe a substantial gap between the three proprietary models and all other open-source models. \nIn particular, GPT-4 is leading the board, achieving an Elo score of 1274. It is almost 200 scores higher than the best open-source alternative on this board -- our Vicuna-13B.\nAfter dropping ties, GPT-4 wins 82% of the matches when it is against Vicuna-13B, and it even wins 79% of the matches when it is against its previous generation GPT-3.5-turbo.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that these open-source models on the leaderboard generally have fewer parameters, in the range of 3B - 14B, than proprietary models.\nIn fact, recent advancements in LLMs and data curation have allowed for significant improvements in performance with smaller models. \n[Google's latest PaLM 2](https://ai.google/discover/palm2) is a great example of this: knowing that PaLM 2 achieves even better performance than its previous generation using smaller model sizes, \nwe remain very optimistic about the potential for open-source language models to catch up. Through our [FastChat-based Chatbot Arena](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat) and this leaderboard effort, \nwe hope to contribute a trusted evaluation platform for evaluating LLMs, and help advance this field and create better language models for everyone.\n \n\n**Comparing proprietary models**  \nHowever, among the three proprietary models, we do observe, based on our collected voting results, \nthat Anthropic's Claude model is preferred by our users over GPT-3.5-turbo, which is often discussed as its opponent.\nIn fact, Claude is highly competitive even when competing against the most powerful model -- OpenAI's GPT-4. \nLooking at the win rate plots (Figure 3 below), among the 66 non-tied matches between GPT-4 and Claude, Claude indeed wins over GPT-4 in 32 (48%) matches. Great job Anthropic team!\n\n**Comparing open-source chatbots**  \nIn this update, we have added RWKV-4-Raven-14B model into the Arena thanks to the community [contribution](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat/issues/633). Unlike all other models, RWKV model is an RNN instead of a transformer-based model; but it performs surprisingly well!\nIt soon uptrends on the leaderboard and is positioned #6 on the overall leaderboard. It wins more than 50% of non-tied matches against all other open-source models except Vicuna. You are welcome to check out its [repo](https://github.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-LM) to learn more about other features like memory saving and fast inference.\nKudos to the RWKV developers.\n\n**Fluctuations of Elo scores**  \nThe Elo scores of existing models can go up and down depending on the results of the new games played. This is similar to the way the Elo scores of chess players vary over time (see [here](https://en.chessbase.com/post/historical-chess-ratings-dynamically-presented)).\nSince the participation of the three strong proprietary models, the Chatbot Arena has never been more competitive than ever before!\nAs a consequence, we observe the Elo scores of all open source models have decreased a bit. This is because open source models lose lots of pairwise matches when they are against the proprietary models.\n\n## Detailed Results\n\n**When does GPT-4 fail?**  \nWe present a few examples in which GPT-4 is not preferred by users.\n\n<img src=\"/images/blog/leaderboard_week2/claude_vs_gpt4.png\" style=\"display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto;\"></img>\n<p style=\"color:gray; text-align: center;\">Figure 1: One example where Claude is preferred over GPT-4.</p>\n\nIn Figure 1, the user posed a tricky question that demanded careful reasoning and planning. Although both Claude and GPT-4 provided similar answers, Claude's response was marginally better as the needle was positioned on top. \nHowever, we observed that the outcome of this example cannot always be replicated due to the randomness of sampling.\nSometimes GPT-4 can also give the same order as Claude, but it fails at this generation trial.\nAdditionally, we noted that the behavior of GPT-4 differed slightly when using the OpenAI API versus the ChatGPT interface, which could be attributed to different prompts, sampling parameters, or other unknown factors.\n\n<img src=\"/images/blog/leaderboard_week2/claude_vs_gpt4_fail.png\" style=\"display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto;\"></img>\n<p style=\"color:gray; text-align: center;\">Figure 2: One example where a user thinks both Claude and GPT-4 are wrong.</p>\n\nIn Figure 2, both Claude and GPT-4 are still struggling with this kind of tricky reasoning questions despite their amazing capabilities.\n\nBesides these tricky cases, there are also a lot of easy questions that do not require complex reasoning or knowledge. In this case, open source models like Vicuna can perform on par with GPT-4, so we might be able to use a slightly weaker (but smaller or cheaper) LLM in place of the more powerful one like GPT-4.\n\n**Win Fraction Matrix**  \nWe present the win fraction of all model pairs in Figure 3.\n<img src=\"/images/blog/leaderboard_week2/win_fraction_matrix.png\" style=\"display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto;\"></img>\n<p style=\"color:gray; text-align: center;\">Figure 3: Fraction of Model A Wins for All Non-tied A vs. B Battles.</p>\n\n**Language-specific leaderboards**  \nLastly, we present two language-specific leaderboards, by isolating the conversation data into two subsets based on the language: (1) English-only and (2) non-English. From Figure 4, we can tell that Koala is worse at non-English languages and ChatGLM-6B is better at non-English languages. This is because of the different compositions of their training data.\n\n<img src=\"/images/blog/leaderboard_week2/english_vs_non_english.png\" style=\"display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto;\"></img>\n<p style=\"color:gray; text-align: center;\">Figure 4: The English-only and non-English leaderboards.</p>\n\nMore figures, analyses, and calculations can be found in this [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1iI_IszGAwSMkdfUrIDI6NfTG7tGDDRxZ?usp=sharing).\n\n## Next Steps\n\n**Help us add more models**  \nSince the launch of Chatbot Arena, we have seen growing interest from the community. Many model developers are eager to put their chatbots into the Arena and see how they perform against others.\nPlease help us add more models by following [this guide](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat/blob/main/docs/arena.md#how-to-add-a-new-model). \n\n**Bring your own self-hosted chatbot (BYOC)**  \nWe also plan to open some APIs to allow competitors to register their self-hosted chatbots and participate in the Arena.\n\n**Area-specific Arena**  \nSimilar to the language-specific Arena, we will extend a single, monolithic leaderboard to more areas, and publish more functionality-specific leaderboards, \nsuch as writing, coding, and reasoning. In which specific area or ability do you want to see the LLMs evaluated?\nPlease give us feedback on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HSWAKCrnFx) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lmsysorg).\n\n## Acknowledgement\nThis blog post is primarily contributed by Lianmin Zheng, Ying Sheng, Hao Zhang, Joseph E.

These models are capable of providing valuable assistance in response to users’ questions/prompts. Notable examples include Alpaca and Vicuna, based on LLaMA, and OpenAssistant and Dolly, based on Pythia.\r\n\r\nDespite the constant release of new models every week, the community faces a challenge in benchmarking these models effectively. Benchmarking LLM assistants is extremely challenging because the problems can be open-ended, and it is very difficult to write a program to automatically evaluate the response quality.\r\nIn this case, we typically have to resort to human evaluation based on pairwise comparison.\r\n\r\nThere are some desired properties for a good benchmark system based on pairwise comparison.\r\n- **Scalability**. The system should scale to a large number of models when it is not feasible to collect sufficient data for all possible model pairs.\r\n- **Incrementality**. The system should be able to evaluate a new model using a relatively small number of trials.\r\n- **Unique order**. The system should provide a unique order for all models. Given any two models, we should be able to tell which ranks higher or whether they are tied.\r\n\r\nExisting LLM benchmark systems rarely satisfy all of these properties. Classical LLM benchmark frameworks, such as [HELM](https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/latest/) and [lm-evaluation-harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness), provide multi-metric measurements for tasks commonly used in academic research. However, they are not based on pairwise comparison and are not effective at evaluating open-ended questions. OpenAI also launched the [evals](https://github.com/openai/evals) project to collect better questions, but this project does not provide ranking mechanisms for all participating models. When we launched our [Vicuna](https://lmsys.org/blog/2023-03-30-vicuna/) model, we utilized a GPT-4-based evaluation pipeline, but it does not provide a solution for scalable and incremental ratings.\r\n\r\nIn this blog post, we introduce Chatbot Arena, an LLM benchmark platform featuring anonymous randomized battles in a crowdsourced manner. Chatbot Arena adopts the [Elo rating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system), which is a widely-used rating system in chess and other competitive games. The Elo rating system is promising to provide the desired property mentioned above. We noticed that the [Anthropic LLM paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.05862.pdf) also adopted the Elo rating system.\r\n\r\nTo collect data, we launched the arena with several popular open-source LLMs one week ago. In the arena, a user can chat with two anonymous models side-by-side and vote for which one is better. This crowdsourcing way of data collection represents some use cases of LLMs in the wild. A comparison between several evaluation methods is shown in Table 2.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<p style=\"color:gray; text-align: center;\">Table 2: Comparison between different evaluation methods.</p>\r\n<table style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th></th> <th>HELM / lm-evaluation-harness</th> <th>OpenAI/eval</th> <th>Alpaca Evaluation</th> <th>Vicuna Evaluation</th> <th>Chatbot Arena</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Question Source</td> <td>Academic datasets</td> <td>Mixed</td> <td>Self-instruct evaluation set</td> <td>GPT-4 generated</td> <td>User prompts</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Evaluator</td> <td>Program</td> <td>Program/Model</td> <td>Human</td> <td>GPT-4</td> <td>User</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Metrics</td> <td>Basic metrics </td> <td>Basic metrics</td> <td>Win rate</td> <td>Win rate</td> <td>Elo ratings</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n## Data Collection\r\nWe hosted the arena at [https://arena.lmsys.org](https://arena.lmsys.org) with our multi-model serving system, [FastChat](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat). When a user enters the arena, they can chat with two anonymous models side-by-side, as shown in Figure 1.\r\nAfter getting responses from the two models, users can continue chatting or vote for the model they think is better. Once a vote is submitted, the model names will be revealed. Users can continue chatting or restart a new battle with two new randomly chosen anonymous models. The platform logs all user interactions. In our analysis, we only use the votes when the model names are hidden.\r\n\r\nThe arena was launched about one week ago and we have collected 4.7k valid anonymous votes since then.  We share some exploratory analysis in this [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lAQ9cKVErXI1rEYq7hTKNaCQ5Q8TzrI5?usp=sharing) and present a short summary here.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"/images/blog/arena/battle_counts.png\" style=\"display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 60%\"></img>\r\n<p style=\"color:gray; text-align: center;\">Figure 2: Battle count of each combination of models</p>\r\n\r\nFigure 2 shows the battles count of each combination of models. When we initially launched the tournament, we had prior information on the likely ranking based on our benchmarks and chose to pair models according to this ranking. We gave preference to what we believed would be strong pairings based on this ranking. However, we later switched to uniform sampling to get better overall coverage of the rankings. Towards the end of the tournament, we also introduced a new model `fastchat-t5-3b`. All of these result in non-uniform model frequency.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"/images/blog/arena/lang_counts.png\" style=\"display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 80%\"></img>\r\n<p style=\"color:gray; text-align: center;\">Figure 3: Battle counts for the top-15 languages.</p>\r\n\r\nFigure 3 plots the language distribution and shows most user prompts are in English.\r\n\r\n## Elo Rating System\r\nThe [Elo rating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system) is a method for calculating the relative skill levels of players, which has been widely adopted in competitive games and sports. The difference in the ratings between two players serves as a predictor of the outcome of a match. The Elo rating system works well for our case because we have multiple models and we run pairwise battles between them.\r\n\r\nIf player A has a rating of `Ra` and player B a rating of `Rb`, the exact formula (using the logistic curve with base 10) for the probability of player A winning is\r\n\r\n<img src=\" https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7c80282e9c95e92d6b210467aab48a8c4c81ef10\" style=\"display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto;\"></img>\r\n\r\nThe ratings of players can be linearly updated after each battle. Suppose player A (with Rating `Ra`) was expected to score `Ea` points but actucally scored `Sa` points. The formula for updating that player's rating is \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1cad9fb1cfc6a8e845493ac9a40eb98541a4641a\" style=\"display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto;\"></img>\r\n\r\nUsing the collected data, we compute the Elo ratings of the models in this [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lAQ9cKVErXI1rEYq7hTKNaCQ5Q8TzrI5?usp=sharing) and put the main results in Table 1. You are welcome to try the notebook and play with the voting data by yourself. The data only contains voting results without conversation histories because releasing the conversation history will raise concerns such as privacy and toxicity.\r\n\r\n## Pairwise Win Rates\r\nAs a basis for calibration, we also present here the pairwise win rates for each model in the tournament (Figure 4) as well as the predicted pairwise win rate estimated using Elo ratings (Figure 5).\r\nBy comparing the figures, we find the elo ratings can predict win rates relatively well.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"/images/blog/arena/win_fraction.png\" style=\"display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto;\"></img>\r\n<p style=\"color:gray; text-align: center;\">Figure 4: Fraction of Model A wins for all non-tied A vs. B battles.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"/images/blog/arena/predicted_win_fraction.png\" style=\"display:block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto;\"></img>\r\n<p style=\"color:gray; text-align: center;\">Figure 5: Predicted win rate using Elo ratings for Model A in an A vs. B battle</p>\r\n\r\n## Future Plans\r\nWe plan to work on the following items:\r\n- Add more closed-source models (ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, and Claude-v1 are avaiable now in the anonymous Arena)\r\n- Add more open-source models\r\n- Release periodically updated leaderboards (e.g., monthly)\r\n- Implement better sampling algorithms, tournament mechanisms, and serving systems to support a much larger number of models\r\n- Provide fine-grained rankings on different task types.\r\n\r\nWe appreciate any feedback from you to make the arena better.\r\n\r\n## Join Us\r\nWe invite the entire community to join this benchmarking effort by contributing your models and votes for the anonymous models you think provide better answers.

However, despite its impressive performance, the training and architecture details of ChatGPT remain unclear, hindering research and open-source innovation in this field. Inspired by the Meta LLaMA and Stanford Alpaca project, we introduce Vicuna-13B, an open-source chatbot backed by an enhanced dataset and an easy-to-use, scalable infrastructure. By fine-tuning a LLaMA base model on user-shared conversations collected from ShareGPT.com, Vicuna-13B has demonstrated competitive performance compared to other open-source models like Stanford Alpaca. This blog post provides a preliminary evaluation of Vicuna-13B's performance and describes its training and serving infrastructure. We also invite the community to interact with our online demo to test the capabilities of this chatbot.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"/images/blog/vicuna/overview.png\" style=\"display:block; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 70%\"></img>\r\n<p style=\"color:gray; text-align: center;\">Figure 2. Workflow Overview</p>\r\n\r\nFigure 2 provides an overview of our work. To begin, we collected around 70K conversations from ShareGPT.com, a website where users can share their ChatGPT conversations. Next, we enhanced the training scripts provided by Alpaca to better handle multi-round conversations and long sequences. The training was done with PyTorch FSDP on 8 A100 GPUs in one day. For serving the demo, we implemented a lightweight distributed serving system. We conducted a preliminary evaluation of the model quality by creating a set of 80 diverse questions and utilizing GPT-4 to judge the model outputs. To compare two different models, we combine the outputs from each model into a single prompt for each question. The prompts are then sent to GPT-4, which assesses which model provides better responses. A detailed comparison of LLaMA, Alpaca, ChatGPT, and Vicuna is shown in Table 1 below.\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style=\"color:gray; text-align: center;\">Table 1.

To ensure data quality, we convert the HTML back to markdown and filter out some inappropriate or low-quality samples. Additionally, we divide lengthy conversations into smaller segments that fit the model's maximum context length.\r\n\r\nOur training recipe builds on top of [Stanford’s alpaca](https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/03/13/alpaca.html) with the following improvements.\r\n- **Multi-turn conversations:** We adjust the training loss to account for multi-turn conversations and compute the fine-tuning loss solely on the chatbot's output.\r\n- **Memory Optimizations:** To enable Vicuna's understanding of long context, we expand the max context length from 512 in alpaca to 2048, which substantially increases GPU memory requirements. We tackle the memory pressure by utilizing [gradient checkpointing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.06174) and [flash attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135).\r\n- **Cost Reduction via Spot Instance:** The 40x larger dataset and 4x sequence length for training poses a considerable challenge in training expenses. We employ [SkyPilot](https://github.com/skypilot-org/skypilot) [managed spot](https://skypilot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/spot-jobs.html) to reduce the cost by leveraging the cheaper spot instances with auto-recovery for preemptions and auto zone switch. This solution slashes costs for training the 7B model from $500 to around $140 and the 13B model from around $1K to $300.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Serving\r\nWe build a serving system that is capable of serving multiple models with distributed workers. It supports flexible plug-in of GPU workers from both on-premise clusters and the cloud. By utilizing a fault-tolerant controller and managed spot feature in SkyPilot, this serving system can work well with cheaper spot instances from multiple clouds to reduce the serving costs. It is currently a lightweight implementation and we are working on integrating more of our latest [research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11665) into it.\r\n\r\n## How To Evaluate a Chatbot?\r\nEvaluating AI chatbots is a challenging task, as it requires examining language understanding, reasoning, and context awareness. With AI chatbots becoming more advanced, current open benchmarks may no longer suffice. For instance, the evaluation dataset used in Stanford’s Alpaca, [self-instruct](https://github.com/yizhongw/self-instruct/tree/main/human_eval), can be effectively answered by SOTA chatbots, making it difficult for humans to discern differences in performance. More limitations include training/test data contamination and the potentially high cost of creating new benchmarks. To tackle these issues, we propose an evaluation framework based on GPT-4 to automate chatbot performance assessment.\r\n\r\nFirst, we devised eight question categories, such as Fermi problems, roleplay scenarios, and coding/math tasks, to test various aspects of a chatbot's performance. Through careful prompt engineering, GPT-4 is able to generate diverse, challenging questions that baseline models struggle with. We select ten questions per category and collect answers from five chatbots: LLaMA, Alpaca, ChatGPT, Bard, and Vicuna. We then ask GPT-4 to rate the quality of their answers based on helpfulness, relevance, accuracy, and detail. We discover that GPT-4 can produce not only relatively consistent scores but also detailed explanations on why such scores are given (detailed examples [link](https://lmsys.org/vicuna_eval/)). However, we also notice that GPT-4 is not very good at judging coding/math tasks.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"/images/blog/vicuna/response-compare.png\" style=\"display: flex; margin-top: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 50%;\"></img>\r\n<p style=\"color:gray; text-align: center;\">Figure 3. Response Comparison Assessed by GPT-4</p>\r\n\r\nFigure 3 displays the comparison results between all baselines and Vicuna. GPT-4 prefers Vicuna over state-of-the-art open-source models (LLaMA, Alpaca) in more than 90% of the questions, and it achieves competitive performance against proprietary models (ChatGPT, Bard). In 45% of the questions, GPT-4 rates Vicuna's response as better or equal to ChatGPT's.\r\nAs GPT-4 assigns a quantitative score to each response on a scale of 10, we calculate the total score for each (baseline, Vicuna) comparison pair by adding up the scores obtained by each model on 80 questions. As shown in Table 2, Vicuna’s total score is 92% of ChatGPT’s. Despite recent advancements, these chatbots still face limitations, such as struggling with basic math problems or having limited coding ability.\r\n\r\n<p style=\"color:gray; text-align: center;\">Table 2. Total Scores Assessed by GPT-4. </p>\r\n\r\n<table class=\"tg\" style=\"display: flex;justify-content: center;\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td class=\"tg-head\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Baseline</span></td>\r\n    <td class=\"tg-head\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Baseline Score</span></td>\r\n    <td class=\"tg-head\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Vicuna Score</span></td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td class=\"tg-body\">LLaMA-13B</td>\r\n    <td class=\"tg-body\" style=\"text-align: right\">513.0</td>\r\n    <td class=\"tg-body\" style=\"text-align: right\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">694.0</span></td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td class=\"tg-body\">Alpaca-13B</td>\r\n    <td class=\"tg-body\" style=\"text-align: right\">583.0</td>\r\n    <td class=\"tg-body\" style=\"text-align: right\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">704.0</span></td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td class=\"tg-body\">Bard</td>\r\n    <td class=\"tg-body\" style=\"text-align: right\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">664.0</span></td>\r\n    <td class=\"tg-body\" style=\"text-align: right\">655.5</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td class=\"tg-body\">ChatGPT</td>\r\n    <td class=\"tg-body\" style=\"text-align: right\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">693.0</span></td>\r\n    <td class=\"tg-body\" style=\"text-align: right\">638.0</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nWhile this proposed evaluation framework demonstrates the potential for assessing chatbots, it is not yet a rigorous or mature approach, as large language models are prone to hallucinate. Developing a comprehensive, standardized evaluation system for chatbots remains an open question requiring further research.\r\n\r\n## Limitations\r\nWe have noticed that, similar to other large language models, Vicuna has certain limitations. For instance, it is not good at tasks involving reasoning or mathematics, and it may have limitations in accurately identifying itself or ensuring the factual accuracy of its outputs. Additionally, it has not been sufficiently optimized to guarantee safety or mitigate potential toxicity or bias. To address the safety concerns, we use the OpenAI [moderation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/moderation/overview) API to filter out inappropriate user inputs in our online demo. Nonetheless, we anticipate that Vicuna can serve as an open starting point for future research to tackle these limitations.\r\n\r\n## Release\r\nIn our first release, we will share the training, serving, and evaluation code on a GitHub repo: [https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat).\r\nWe also released the Vicuna-13B model [weights](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat#vicuna-weights).\r\nThere is no plan to release the dataset.  \r\nJoin our [Discord](https://discord.gg/HSWAKCrnFx) server and follow our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lmsysorg) to get the latest updates.\r\n\r\n## License\r\nThe online demo is a research preview intended for non-commercial use only, subject to the model [License](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama/blob/main/MODEL_CARD.md) of LLaMA, [Terms of Use](https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use) of the data generated by OpenAI, and [Privacy Practices](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sharegpt-share-your-chatg/daiacboceoaocpibfodeljbdfacokfjb) of ShareGPT.
