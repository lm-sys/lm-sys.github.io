Vertex AI utilizes EAGLE-3, adding a small draft head (2-5% of the target model) to internal layers, simplifying training and achieving ~2x-3x decoding speedup. **This post outlines our pipeline for data cleaning, embeddings, training, and serving EAGLE-3 with SGLang on Vertex AI at scale.**\n\n<img src=\"/images/blog/eagle3-vertex/cover.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"50%\" />\n</p>\n\nFor those working with LLMs, the one token at a time bottleneck is a familiar challenge. Standard autoregressive generation is inherently sequential. This creates a classic memory-bound process that limits speed not by calculation, but by the time required to read massive model weights from memory for **every single step**, leading to underutilized GPU cores.\n\nThe solution is **speculative decoding**. This optimization technique speeds up the slow, sequential process of your large LLM (the target model) generating one token at a time, by introducing a draft mechanism.\n\nThis draft mechanism rapidly proposes several next tokens at once. The large target model then verifies these proposals in a single, parallel batch. It accepts the longest matching prefix from its own predictions and continues generation from that new point.\n\nBut not all draft mechanisms are created equal. The classic draft-target approach uses a separate, smaller LLM model as the drafter, which means you have to host, and manage more serving resources, causing additional costs. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"/images/blog/eagle3-vertex/draft_model.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"50%\" />\n</p>\n\nThis is where [EAGLE-3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01840) (Extrapolative Attention Guided LEarning) comes in. EAGLE-3 is a more advanced approach. Instead of a whole separate model, it attaches an extremely lightweight 'draft head'—just 2-5% of the target model's size—directly to its internal layers. This head operates at both feature and token level, ingesting features from the target model's hidden states to extrapolate and predict a tree of future tokens.\n\nThe result? All the benefits of speculative decoding while eliminat[ing] the overhead of training and running a second model.\n\nEAGLE-3's approach is far more efficient than the complex, resource-intensive task of training and maintaining a separate, multi-billion parameter draft model. You train only a lightweight 'draft head'—just **2% to 5% of the target model size**—that is added as part to your existing model. This simpler, efficient training process delivers **a significant 2x-3x decoding performance gain** for models like Llama 70B (depending on the workload types, e.g. multi-turn, code, long context and more). \n\n<img src=\"/images/blog/eagle3-vertex/target_model_eagle3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"50%\" />\n</p>\n\nBut moving even this streamlined EAGLE-3 approach from a paper to a scaled, production-ready cloud service is a real engineering journey. This post shares our technical pipeline, key challenges, and the hard-won lessons we learned along the way.\n\n\n## Challenge #1: Preparing the data\n\nThe EAGLE-3 head needs to be trained. The obvious first step is to grab a generic public available dataset. Most of these datasets present challenges, including:\n\n- **Strict Terms of Use:** These datasets are generated using models that do not allow using them to develop models that would compete with original providers.\n- **PII Contamination:** Some of these datasets contain significant PII, including names, locations, and even financial identifiers.\n- **No quality guaranteed:** Some datasets only work great for general \"demo\" use cases, but not work best for real customers' specialized workload.\n\nUsing this data as-is is not an option.\n\n### Lesson 1: Build a Synthetic Data Generation Pipeline\nOne solution is to build a synthetic data generation pipeline. Depending on our customer's use cases, we select the right dataset not only with good-quality but also **matches best** with our customer's production traffic for various different workloads. Then you can extract only the user prompts from these datasets and apply rigorous DLP (Data Loss Prevention) and PII filtering. These clean prompts apply a chat template, tokenize them and then they can be fed into your target model (e.g., Llama 3.3 70B) to collect its responses.\n\nThis approach provides target-generated data that is not only compliant and clean, but also well-matched to the model's actual output distribution. This is ideal for training the draft head.\n\n<img src=\"/images/blog/eagle3-vertex/data_pipeline.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"50%\" />\n</p>\n\n## Challenge #2: Engineering the training pipeline\n\nAnother key decision is how to feed the EAGLE-3 head its training data. You have two distinct paths: **online training**, where embeddings are 'generated on the fly', and **offline training**, where 'embeddings are generated before training'.\n\nIn our case, we chose an **offline training** approach because it requires much less hardware than online training. This process involves pre-calculating all the features and embeddings before we train the EAGLE-3 head. We save them to GCS and they become the training data for our lightweight EAGLE-3 head. Once you have the data, the training itself is fast. **Given the diminutive size of the EAGLE-3 head, initial training with our original dataset required approximately one day on a single host.** However, as we've scaled our dataset, training times have commensurately increased, now spanning several days.\n\n<img src=\"/images/blog/eagle3-vertex/training_pipeline.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"50%\" />\n</p>\n\nThis process taught us two not negligible lessons you need to keep in mind.\n\n### Lesson 2: Chat Templates Are Not Optional\nWhile we were training for the instruction-tuned model, we found that EAGLE-3 performance can vary a lot when the chat template is not right. You must apply the target model's specific chat template (e.g., Llama 3's) before you generate the features and embeddings. If you just concatenate raw text, the embeddings will be incorrect, and your head will learn to predict the wrong distribution.\n\n### Lesson 3: Mind the Mask\nDuring training, the model is fed both the prompt and **response** representations. But the EAGLE-3 head should only be learning to predict the response representation. You must manually mask the prompt part in your loss function. If you **don't**, the head wastes capacity learning to predict the prompt it was already given, and performance will suffer.\n\n<img src=\"/images/blog/eagle3-vertex/mind_mask.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"50%\" />\n</p>\n\n\n## Challenge #3: Serving and Scaling\n\nWith a trained EAGLE-3 head, we proceeded to the serving **phase**. This phase introduced significant scaling challenges. Here are our key learnings.\n\n### Lesson 4: Your Serving Framework Is Key\n\nBy working closely in partnership with the SGLang team, we successfully landed EAGLE-3 to production with best performance. The technical reason is that SGLang implements a crucial tree attention kernel. This special kernel is crucial because EAGLE-3 generates a 'draft tree' of possibilities (not just a simple chain), and SGLang's kernel is specifically designed to verify all of those branching paths in parallel in a single step. Without this, you're leaving performance on the table.\n\n### Lesson 5: Don't Let your CPU Bottleneck your GPU\n\nEven after accelerating your LLM with EAGLE-3, you can hit another performance wall: **the CPU**. When your GPUs are running LLM inference, unoptimized software will waste a huge amount of time on CPU overhead—such as kernel launch and metadata bookkeeping. In a normal synchronous scheduler, the GPU runs a step (like Draft), then idles while the CPU does its bookkeeping and launches the next Verify step. These sync bubbles add up, wasting huge amounts of valuable GPU time.\n\n<img src=\"/images/blog/eagle3-vertex/normal_scheduling.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"50%\" />\n</p>\n\nWe solved this by using SGLang's **Zero-Overhead Overlap Scheduler**. This scheduler is specifically tuned for speculative decoding's multi-step *Draft -> Verify -> Draft* Extend workflow . The key is to overlap computation. While the GPU is busy running the current Verify step, the CPU is already working in parallel to launch the kernels for the next Draft and Draft Extend steps . This eliminates the idle bubble by ensuring the GPU's next job is always ready, using a `FutureMap`, a smart data structure that lets the CPU prepare the next batch WHILE the GPU is still working.\n<img src=\"/images/blog/eagle3-vertex/overlap_scheduling.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"50%\" />\n</p>\n\nBy eliminating this CPU overhead, the overlap scheduler gives us an additional **10% - 20% speedup** across the board. It proves that a great model is only half the battle; you need a runtime that can keep up.\n\n## Benchmark Results\nAfter this journey, was it worth it? Absolutely.\n\nWe benchmarked our trained EAGLE-3 head against the non-speculative baseline using SGLang with Llama 4 Scout 17B Instruct. Our benchmarks show a **2x-3x speedup in decoding latency and significant throughput gains** depending on the workload types.\n\nSee the full details and benchmark it yourself using our comprehensive notebook.\n\n### Metric 1: Median Time Per Output Token (TPOT)\n\n<img src=\"/images/blog/eagle3-vertex/tpop_benchmark.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"50%\" />\n</p>\n\nThis chart shows the better latency performance of EAGLE-3. The **Time Per Output Token (TPOT) chart** shows EAGLE-3-accelerated model (green line) consistently achieves a lower (faster) latency than the baseline (blue line) across all tested concurrency levels.\n\n### Metric 2: Output Throughput\n\n<img src=\"/images/blog/eagle3-vertex/output_throughput.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"50%\" />\n</p>\n\nThis chart further highlights EAGLE-3's throughput advantage. The **Token Throughput vs. Concurrency chart** clearly demonstrates that the EAGLE-3-accelerated model (green line) consistently and substantially outperforms the baseline model (blue line).\n\nWhile similar observations hold true for larger models, it is worth noting that an increase in Time to First Token (TTFT) may be observed compared to other performance metrics. Also, these performances vary according to the task task-dependent, as illustrated by the following examples:\n\n<img src=\"/images/blog/eagle3-vertex/output_speed.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"50%\" />\n</p>\n\n## Conclusion: Now It's Your Turn\nEAGLE-3 isn't just a research concept; it's a production-ready pattern that can deliver a tangible 2x speedup in decoding latency. But getting it to scale requires a real engineering effort. To reliably deploy this technology for your users, you must:\n\n1. **Build** a compliant synthetic data pipeline.\n2. **Correctly handle** chat templates and loss masks and train the model on a large scale of dataset.\n\nOn Vertex AI, we've already streamlined this entire process for you, providing an optimized container and infrastructure designed to scale your LLM-based applications.
