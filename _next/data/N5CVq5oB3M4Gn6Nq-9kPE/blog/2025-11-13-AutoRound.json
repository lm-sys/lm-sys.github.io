It uses signed gradient descent to jointly optimize weight rounding and clipping ranges, enabling accurate low-bit quantization (e.g., INT2 - INT8) with minimal accuracy loss in most scenarios. For example, at INT2 precision, it outperforms popular baselines by up to 2.1x higher in relative accuracy. At INT4 precision, AutoRound continues to hold a competitive edge in most cases. The image below provides an overview of the core algorithm in AutoRound.\n\nFull technical details are presented in the AutoRound paper:\n\n👉 [Optimize Weight Rounding via Signed Gradient Descent for the Quantization of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05516)\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"/images/blog/AutoRound/autoround_overview.png\" width=\"80%\">\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\" style=\"color:gray; text-align: center;\"><em>AutoRound algorithm overview</em></p>\n\nDespite its robust performance, AutoRound remains fast and lightweight—quantizing a 72B model takes only 37 minutes on a single GPU under light mode.\n\nIt further supports mixed-bit tuning, lm-head quantization, GPTQ/AWQ/GGUF format exports, and customizable tuning recipes.\n\n\n\n## AutoRound Highlights\n\nAutoRound is not only focused on algorithmic innovation and exploration, but also widely recognized for its completeness in quantization engineering.\n\n- **Accuracy:** deliver superior accuracy at low-bit precision\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"/images/blog/AutoRound/int4_accs.png\" width=\"80%\">\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\" style=\"color:gray; text-align: center;\"><em>Average accuracy of 10+ tasks at INT4 weight</em></p>\n\n- **Schemes:** support weight-only quantization, weight & activation quantization, dynamic and static for activation quantization\n- **Mixed-bits:** propose an effective algorithm to generate mixed-bits / other data types schemes in minutes\n- **Broad Compatibility:**\n  - Support nearly all popular LLM architectures and over 10 vision-language models (VLMs)\n  - Support Devices: CPU, Intel GPU, CUDA\n  - Support Data Types: INT2 - INT8, MXFP4, NVFP4, FP8, and MXFP8\n- **Efficiency:** Enables block-wise tuning to lower VRAM usage without sacrificing throughput yet fast\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"/images/blog/AutoRound/timecost.png\" width=\"80%\"> \n</p>\n<p align=\"center\" style=\"color:gray; text-align: center;\"><em>Quantization time cost comparison</em></p>\n\n- **Community adoption:** \n  - Work seamlessly with SGLang, TorchAO, Transformers, and vLLM\n  - Widely used by HuggingFace model hubs such as [Intel](https://huggingface.co/Intel), [OPEA](https://huggingface.co/OPEA),  [Kaitchup](https://huggingface.co/kaitchup), and [fbaldassarri](https://huggingface.co/fbaldassarri) with approximately two million downloads\n- **Export Formats:**\n  - AutoRound\n  - GPTQ\n  - AWQ\n  - GGUF\n  - Compressed-tensor (initial support)\n\n\n## Integration Overview\n\nSGLang provides a next-generation inference runtime built for scalable, low-latency LLM deployment.
