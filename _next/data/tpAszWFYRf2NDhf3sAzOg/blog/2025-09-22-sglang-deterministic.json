By integrating batch invariant kernels released by Thinking Machines Lab, as well as customized attention kernels and sampling operators, we have **enabled deterministic inference** while maintaining compatibility with crucial features, including **chunked prefill**, **CUDA graphs**, **radix cache**, and **non-greedy sampling**. \n\n## Why Deterministic Inference Matters\n\nThe ability to achieve consistent outputs from large language models (LLMs) inference is increasingly important. For example, the indeterminism of inference results can implicitly transform on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) into off-policy RL as [researchers pointed out](https://fengyao.notion.site/off-policy-rl). However, even if we turn the temperature down to 0 in SGLang, the sampling is still not deterministic due to the use of dynamic batching and radix cache (past discussions [here](https://docs.sglang.ai/references/faq.html#the-results-are-not-deterministic-even-with-a-temperature-of-0)) .\n\nIn pursuit of deterministic LLM inference, the Thinking Machines Lab published a [blog](https://thinkingmachines.ai/blog/defeating-nondeterminism-in-llm-inference/) detailing their findings. The largest source of nondeterminism is the varying batch sizes: Even when a user repeatedly submits the same prompt, the output can vary across runs, since the request may be batched together with other users’ requests, and differences in batch size can lead to nondeterministic inference results.\n\nTo explain more, different batch sizes will influence the reduction splitting process of kernels. This leads to  varying order and size for each reduction block, which can cause nondeterministic outputs due to the non-associativity of floating-point arithmetic. To fix this, they replaced reduction kernels (RMSNorm, matrix multiplication, attention, etc…) with a batch-invariant implementation. These kernels were also released as [a companion library](https://github.com/thinking-machines-lab/batch_invariant_ops) for external integration. \n\n![figure1](/images/blog/deterministic/deterministic_intro.png)<small><center>*He, Horace and Thinking Machines Lab, \"Defeating Nondeterminism in LLM Inference\", \nThinking Machines Lab: Connectionism, Sep 2025.*</center></small>\n\n\nBuilding on the work of Thinking Machines Lab, SGLang delivers a robust, high-throughput solution for deterministic LLM inference, combining batch-invariant kernels, CUDA graphs, radix cache, and chunked prefill with efficient performance. Determinism has been extensively validated through comprehensive tests and RL training experiments.\n\nKey enhancements include:\n- **Integration of batch-invariant kernels** from Thinking Machines Lab, including mean, log-softmax, and matrix multiplication kernels.\n- **Implementation of batch-invariant attention kernels** with fixed split-KV size. Multiple backends are supported, including FlashInfer, FlashAttention 3, and Triton.\n- **Full compatibility with common inference features**, such as chunked prefill, CUDA graph, radix cache, all of which remain supported when deterministic inference is enabled.\n- **Expose a per-request seed** in sampling arguments, allowing users to enable deterministic inference even when temperature > 0.\n- **Better performance**: Compared to the **61.5%** slowdown reported in TML’s blog, SGLang achieves an average slowdown of only **34.35%** with the FlashInfer and FlashAttention 3 backends.\n\n\n## Results\n\n\n### Verifying Deterministic Behavior\n\nWe introduce [a deterministic test suite](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/blob/f1d789231896da438749b395f7bf007a5b0819c0/python/sglang/test/test_deterministic.py) to verify whether inference results remain consistent under different batching conditions. The test covers three subtests, progressing from simple to more challenging:\n\n- Single: Run the same prompt across varying batch sizes and check if outputs remain identical.\n- Mixed: Mix different types of prompts (short prompts and long prompts) within the same batch and verify consistency.\n- Prefix: Use prompts derived from the same long text with different prefix lengths, batch them randomly, and test whether results are reproducible across trials.\n\nHere are the results from 50 sampling trials. The numbers indicate the count of unique outputs observed for each subtest (lower = more deterministic).\n\n| Attention Backend | Mode | Single Test | Mixed Test (P1/P2/Long) | Prefix Test (prefix_len=1/511/2048/4097) | \n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| FlashInfer | Normal | 4| 3 / 3 / 2 | 5 / 8 / 18 / 2 |\n| FlashInfer | Deterministic | 1 | 1 / 1 / 1 | 1 / 1 / 1 / 1 |\n| FA3 | Normal | 3 | 3 / 2 / 2 | 4 / 4 / 10 / 1 |\n| FA3 | Deterministic | 1 | 1 / 1 / 1 | 1 / 1 / 1 / 1 |\n| Triton | Normal | 3 | 2 / 3 / 1 | 5 / 4 / 13 / 2 |\n| Triton | Deterministic | 1 | 1 / 1 / 1 | 1 / 1 / 1 / 1 |\n---\n<small>*Tested on QWen3-8B</small>\n\n<small>* Cuda graph, chunked prefill are enabled. Radix cache is disabled for Flashinfer and Triton since their support is still in progress. </small>\n\n\n### CUDA Graph Acceleration \n\nCUDA graphs can accelerate the inference process by consolidating multiple kernel launches into a single launch. Our evaluation compared the total throughput of deterministic inference with and without CUDA graphs enabled. The test workload consisted of 16 requests, each with an input length of 1024 and an output length of 1024. The results show an at least 2.79x speedup across all attention kernels when CUDA graphs is utilized.\n\n| Attention Backend | CUDA Graph | Throughput (tokens/s) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| FlashInfer | Disabled | 441.73 |\n| FlashInfer | Enabled | 1245.51 (2.82x) |\n| FA3 | Disabled | 447.64 |\n| FA3 | Enabled | 1247.64 (2.79x) |\n| Triton | Disabled | 419.64 |\n| Triton | Enabled | 1228.36 (2.93x) |\n---\n<small>*Setup: QWen3-8B, TP1, H100 80GB  </small>\n\n<small>*We disabled radix cache for all performance benchmarks since FlashInfer and Triton Radix Cache support is still in progress. </small>\n\n### Measuring RL Performance\n\nWe measured end-to-end latency for both non-deterministic and deterministic modes using three common RL rollout workloads (256 requests with varying input/output lengths).\n\nDeterministic inference is generally usable, with most slowdowns ranging from 25% to 45%. The majority of this overhead comes from unoptimized batch-invariant kernels (matrix multiplication and attention), indicating significant room for performance improvements\n\n| Attention Backend | Mode | Input 1024 Output 1024| Input 4096 Output 4096 | Input 8192 Output 8192 | \n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| FlashInfer | Normal | 30.85 | 332.32 | 1623.87 |\n| FlashInfer | Deterministic | 43.99 (+42.6%) | 485.16 (+46.0%) | 2020.13 (+24.4%) |\n| FA3 | Normal | 34.70 | 379.85 | 1438.41 |\n| FA3 | Deterministic | 44.14 (+27.2%) | 494.56 (+30.2%) | 1952.92 (+35.7%) |\n| Triton | Normal | 36.91 | 400.59 | 1586.05  |\n| Triton | Deterministic | 57.25 (+55.1%) | 579.43 (+44.64%) | 2296.60 (+44.80%) |\n---\n<small>*Setup: QWen3-8B, TP1, H200 140GB. </small>\n\n<small>*We disabled radix cache for all performance benchmarks since FlashInfer and Triton Radix Cache support is still in progress. </small>\n\nWe acknowledge that deterministic inference is significantly slower than normal mode. We recommend using it primarily for debugging and reproducibility. Future work will focus on accelerating deterministic inference, with the goal of reducing the performance gap to under 20%, or ideally achieving parity with normal mode.\n\n\n\n## Usage\n\n### Environment Setup\n\nTo set up the environment, install SGLang from source:\n```bash\n# Use the latest main branch\ngit clone https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang.git\ncd sglang\n\n# Install the python packages\npip install --upgrade pip\npip install -e \"python[all]\"\n```\n### Launching the Server\n\nSGLang supports deterministic inference across multiple models. For example, with Qwen3-8B you only need to add the `--enable-deterministic-inference` flag when launching the server:\n\n```bash\npython3 -m sglang.launch_server \\\n    --model-path Qwen/Qwen3-8B \\\n    --attention-backend <flashinfer|fa3|triton> \\\n    --enable-deterministic-inference\n```\n\n## Technical Details\n\n\n### Chunked Prefill\n\nSGLang's chunked prefill technique is designed to manage requests with long contexts. However, its default chunking strategy violates the determinism requirement for attention kernels.  \n\nAs illustrated in the figure, consider two input sequences, `seq_a` and `seq_b`, each with a context length of 6,000. The maximum chunk size for chunk prefill is 8192, while the required split-KV size for deterministic attention is 2,048. Each sequence can be partitioned into three smaller units (`a1` to `a3` and `b1` to `b3`), with lengths of 2,048, 2,048, and 1,904, respectively. If these smaller units remain intact during chunk prefilling, then they can be processed by the same attention kernel and lead to deterministic reduction behavior.\n\n\n<img src=\"/images/blog/deterministic/chunked_prefill.png\" style=\"width: 30vw; min-width: 200px;\" />\n\n\nThe standard chunking strategy operates on a \"best-effort\" principle. In this example, this strategy tries to generate a `chunk_1` of 8,192 tokens by splitting the `b2` unit of `seq_b` into two smaller parts. This can cause inconsistent truncation points since the length of `b2` after splitting depends on the length of `seq_a`. To address this, we adapted the chunking logic to **align the truncation point with an integer multiple of the split_kv_size**. This adjustment ensures that the processing of `b2` is deferred to a subsequent chunk, allowing it to be computed as a complete unit by the attention kernel. \n\n\n### Reproducible Non-Greedy Sampling\nTo extend determinism beyond greedy decoding, we introduce a new sampling function: `multinomial_with_seed`.\n\nInstead of relying on `torch.multinomial`, which is inherently nondeterministic under batching, this operator perturbs logits with Gumbel noise generated from a **seeded hash function**. As a result, the same `(inputs, seed)` pair always yields the same sample, even when temperature > 0.\n\n\nThis modification enables **deterministic multinomial sampling** while preserving the stochasticity required by reinforcement learning rollouts.\n\n\n### RL Framework Integration (slime)\n\nWe [integrated](https://github.com/THUDM/slime/pull/361) deterministic inference with temperature > 0 into slime’s GRPO training recipe. In preliminary experiments, repeated RL training runs produced **identical rollouts response and loss value for the first iterations**, confirming that the rollout process itself is deterministic. This establishes a strong foundation for **true on-policy RL training**, where reproducibility of rollouts is critical for debugging and fair comparison of algorithms.\n\n**Note**: Further work is needed on the training side (e.g., Megatron, FSDP) to fully support true on-policy RL training.\n\n## Future Work\nOur future efforts will focus on enhancing deterministic inference by addressing the following key areas:\n- **Faster batch invariant kernels**: Batch invariant kernels are the bottleneck of performance, so we'll work on optimizing their configurations and potentially rewriting them to boost performance. This is also critical for improving the speed of RL rollouts.\n- **Support for MoE models**: Currently we only support deterministic inference for dense models like QWen3-8B or LLaMa-3.1-8B. In the future we plan to expand our support to MoE models like Qwen3-30B-A3B or DeepSeek-V3.\n- **True On-Policy RL**: We plan to further integrate deterministic inference into reinforcement learning frameworks (e.g., [slime](https://github.com/THUDM/slime)) to enable reproducible sampling, with the ultimate goal of achieving true on-policy training.\n- **Enhancing Radix Cache Functionality**: We will improve the radix tree to enable compatibility with a wider variety of attention kernels, moving beyond current limitation to the FlashAttention 3 backend.\n- **Tensor Parallelism**: TP1 and TP2 are deterministic due to consistent floating-point addition order; larger TP setups require modifications to reduce kernels for determinism.\n- A roadmap for deterministic inference features can be found in [this issue](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/issues/10278). \n\n## Acknowledgement\nWe would like to extend our heartfelt gratitude to the following teams and collaborators:\n- **SGLang team and community**: Baizhou Zhang, Biao He, Qiaolin Yu, Xinyuan Tong, Ke Bao, Yineng Zhang, Chi Zhang, Ying Sheng, Lianmin Zheng and many others\n- **Flashinfer team and community**:  Wenxuan Tan, Yilong Zhao, Zihao Ye\n- **slime team and community**: Yusheng Su, Zilin Zhu\n- **Thinking Machines Lab**: for their awesome [blog](https://thinkingmachines.ai/blog/defeating-nondeterminism-in-llm-inference/) and [batch_invariant_ops library](https://github.com/thinking-machines-lab/batch_invariant_ops)","slug":"2025-09-22-sglang-deterministic"},"__N_SSG":true}
