Large Model Systems (LMSYS Corp.) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that depends on donations. The donations will be mostly used to cover the computing expenses and development activities for our projects.
We welcome diverse forms of donations and sponsorships, including but not limited to cash, computing devices (e.g., GPUs), and cloud credits. Please contact us at [lmsys.org@gmail.com](mailto:lmsys.org@gmail.com) to learn more about sponsorships and benefits.

It is essential for us to receive donations from many sources to maintain the [public charity status](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/exempt-organizations-annual-reporting-requirements-form-990-schedules-a-and-b-public-charity-support-test).
