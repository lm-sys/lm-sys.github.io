We have compiled a list of 80 challenging questions, spanning 9 categories such as writing, roleplay, math, coding, and knowledge. We then asked each LLM to generate responses to these questions, and used GPT-4 to evaluate and determine which LLM produced the better responses.
Explore the questions, responses, and judgement results below! The code of this evaluation pipeline is available [here](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat/tree/main/fastchat/eval).
