Large Model Systems Organization (LMSYS Corp) is a non-profit focused on incubating open-source projects and research.
Our mission is to make large AI models accessible to everyone by co-developing open models, datasets, systems, and evaluation tools. We conduct cutting-edge machine learning research, develop open-source software, train large language models for broad accessibility, and build distributed systems to optimize their training and inference.

### History
LMSYS originated from a multi-university collaboration involving UC Berkeley, Stanford, UCSD, CMU, and MBZUAI in 2023.
It was established as a non-profit corporation in September 2024 to incubate early-stage open-source and research projects.
It became well-known for its impactful flagship projects, including:

- [Chatbot Arena (graduated)](https://lmarena.ai/)
- [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/tree/main)
- [FastChat](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat/tree/main)
- [Vicuna LLM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicuna_LLM)

These projects feature open models with millions of downloads, crowdsourced platforms with millions of users, and efficient systems that are orders of magnitude faster.
